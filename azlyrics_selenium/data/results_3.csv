Whole Heart (Hold Me Now),Hillsong United,"Hold me now
In the hands that created the heavens
Find me now
Where the grace runs as deep as Your scars
You pulled me from the clay
You set me on a rock
Called me by Your Name
And made my heart whole again

Lifted up
And my knees know it's all for Your glory
I might stand
With more reasons to sing than to fear
You pulled me from the clay
Set me on a rock
Called me by Your Name
And made my heart whole again

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

Once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds me now

And that grace
Owns the ground where the grave did
Where all my shame remains
Left for dead in Your wake
You crashed those age-old gates
You left no stone unturned
You stepped out of that grave
And shouldered me all the way

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

Once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds me now

Healed and forgiven
Look where my chains are now
Death has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds that ground
And Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

Once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds me now

Healed and forgiven
Look where my chains are now
Death has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds that ground
And Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now

Healed and forgiven
Look where my chains are now
Death has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds that ground
And Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now"
99 Luftballons,Nena,"Hast du etwas Zeit für mich?
Dann singe ich ein Lied für dich
Von neunundneunzig Luftballons
Auf ihrem Weg zum Horizont
Denkst du vielleicht grad an mich?
Dann singe ich ein Lied für dich
Von neunundneunzig Luftballons
Und dass sowas von sowas kommt

Neunundneunzig Luftballons
Auf ihrem Weg zum Horizont
Hielt man für Ufos aus dem All
Darum schickte ein General
'ne Fliegerstaffel hinterher
Alarm zu geben, wenn's so wär
Dabei war'n dort am Horizont
Nur neunundneunzig Luftballons

Neunundneunzig Düsenflieger
Jeder war ein großer Krieger
Hielten sich für Captain Kirk
Das gab ein großes Feuerwerk
Die Nachbarn haben nichts gerafft
Und fühlten sich gleich angemacht
Dabei schoss man am Horizont
Auf neunundneunzig Luftballons

Neunundneunzig Kriegsminister
Streichholz und Benzinkanister
Hielten sich für schlaue Leute
Witterten schon fette Beute
Riefen: ""Krieg!"" und wollten Macht
Mann, wer hätte das gedacht
Dass es einmal so weit kommt
Wegen neunundneunzig Luftballons
Wegen neunundneunzig Luftballons
Neunundneunzig Luftballons

Neunundneunzig jahre Krieg
Ließen keinen Platz für Sieger
Kriegsminister gibt's nicht mehr
Und auch keine Düsenflieger
Heute zieh ich meine Runden
Seh die Welt in Trümmern liegen
Hab 'n Luftballon gefunden
Denk an dich und lass ihn fliegen"
Strangers Like Me,Peter Hollens,"Whatever you do, I'll do it too
Show me everything and tell me how
It all means something
And yet nothing to me

I can see there's so much to learn
It's all so close and yet so far
I see myself as people see me
Oh, I just know there's something bigger out there

I wanna know, can you show me
I wanna know about these
Strangers like me
Tell me more, please show me
Something's familiar about these strangers like me

Every gesture, every move that she makes
Makes me feel like never before
Why do I have
This growing need to be beside her

Ooo, these emotions I never knew
Of some other world far beyond this place
Beyond the trees, above the clouds
I see before me a new horizon

I wanna know, can you show me
I wanna know about these strangers like me
Tell me more, please show me
Something's familiar about these strangers like me

Come with me now to see my world
Where there's beauty beyond your dreams
Can you feel the things I feel
Right now, with you
Take my hand
There's a world I need to know

I wanna know, can you show me
I wanna know about these strangers like me
Tell me more, please show me
Something's familiar about these strangers like me

I wanna know"

I want you to know
That deep down inside of me...

You are
You are, you are, you are

Regret,Will Reagan,"I remember back then
Back when we were friends
You knew where we were going
I knew where we'd been

But now that I am older
I feel it all, but I feel nothing
I remember then
I feel nothing, but I feel it all
I remember then
I remember then

I used to know Your matters
You used to know my sins
I met You without warning
You taught me how to bend
We walk within the borders
Of [?]
We held each other's banter
And saw the flood begin

And now that I am older
I feel it all, but I feel nothing
I remember then
I feel nothing, but I feel it all
I remember then
I remember then

I regret what I've become
Even if I live to share it
I regret what saw my eyes
When I could no longer bear it
I regret what I've become
Even if I live to share it
I regret what saw my eyes
When I could no longer bear it

I stand before You reckless
And haunted by the truth
I'm feeling like a slow hit [?]
My throat is feeling dry
And my hands are feeling numb
I couldn't see it coming
You would've seen me run

I used to know You're honest
You used to know I'm true
I used to know You woo'd me
And stayed to see me through"
Simple Gospel,United Pursuit,"I want to know you, Lord
Like I know a friend
I want to know you, Lord

I want to know you, Lord
Like I know a friend
I want to know you, Lord

So I'm laying down all my religion
I'm laying down
I want to know you, Lord
I'm laying down all my religion
I'm laying down
I want to know you, Lord

I use to think that I could box you in
But I'm laying down
I want to know you, Lord
I use to think that I could box you in
But I'm laying down
I want to know you, Lord

I'm laying down all my religion
I'm laying down
I want to you know you, Lord
I'm laying down all my religion
I'm laying down
I want to know you, Lord
I want to know you, Lord

Lord, I've been told to be ashamed
Lord, I've been told I don't measure up
Lord, I've been told I'm not good enough
But you're here with me

I reach out and you find me in the dust
You say no amount of untruths can separate us
I reach out and you find me in the dust
You say no amount of untruths can separate us
I reach out and you find me in the dust
You say no amount of untruths can separate us

I will rejoice in the simple gospel
I will rejoice in you, Lord

And I reach out and you find me in the dust
You say no amount of untruths can separate us

I will rejoice in the simple gospel
I will rejoice in you, Lord

I will rejoice in the simple gospel
I will rejoice in you, Lord"
Medley: I Love You Lord / Passion (Acoustic),Hillsong Young & Free,"[Laura Toggs:]
I love You, Lord
And I lift my voice
To worship You
Oh, my soul, rejoice
Take joy my King
In what You hear
And let it be a sweet, sweet sound
Let it be a sweet, sweet sound
Let it be a sweet, sweet sound
In Your ear

All I have is Yours
Take my life Jesus
Let my heart sing
How I love You, Lord
How I need You, Jesus
Who I am, who I have, Jesus
I love You (You are everything)
I love You (In my life, take who I am)

I love You (I love You, Lord)
Ohh (So I sing, so I sing)
I love You
I love You
I love You

You're brighter than the sun
Risen from the shadows
Seated on the throne of majesty
Higher than the skies and all we see

You're brighter than the sun
Risen from the shadows
Seated on the throne of majesty
Higher than the skies and all we see"
Highlands (Song Of Ascent),Hillsong United,"O how high would I climb mountains
If the mountains were where You hide
O how far I'd scale the valleys
If You graced the other side

O how long have I chased rivers
From lowly seas to where they rise
Against the rush of grace descending
From the source of its supply

Cause in the highlands and the heartache
You're neither more or less inclined
I would search and stop at nothing
You're just not that hard to find

Oh I will praise You on the mountain
And I will praise you when the mountain's in my way
You're the summit where my feet are
So I will praise You in the valleys all the same
No less God within the shadows
No less faithful when the night leads me astray
Cause You're the Heaven where my heart is
In the highlands and the heartache all the same

O how far beneath Your glory
Does Your kindness extend the path
From where your feet rest on the sunrise
To where You sweep the sinner's past

And though how fast would you come running
If just to shadow me through the night
Trace my steps through all my failures
And walk me out the other side

For who could dare ascend that mountain
That valleyed hill called Calvary
But for the One I call Good Shepherd
Who like a lamb was slain for me

Oh I will praise You on the mountain
And I will praise you when the mountain's in my way
You're the summit where my feet are
So I will praise You in the valleys all the same
No less God within the shadows
No less faithful when the night leads me astray
Cause You're the Heaven where my heart is
In the highlands and the heartache all the same

Sing it out

Whatever I walk through
Wherever I am
Your Name can move mountains
Wherever I stand
And if ever I walk through
The valley of death
I'll sing through the shadows
My song of ascent

Whatever I walk through
Wherever I am
Your Name can move mountains
Wherever I stand
And if ever I walk through
The valley of death
I'll sing through the shadows
My song of ascent
My song of ascent

Sing it out

My song of ascent

From the gravest of all valleys
Come the pastures we call grace
A mighty river flowing upwards
From a deep but empty grave

So I will praise You on the mountain
And I will praise you when the mountain's in my way
You're the summit where my feet are
Yes you are
So I will praise You in the valleys all the same
No less God within the shadows
No less faithful when the night leads me astray
You're the Heaven where my heart is
In the highlands and the heartache all the same"
To The One,UPPERROOM,"It's the mystery
Of this hope in me
How You hold the stars
Yet You hold my heart

One who's first and last
Wiped away my past
Perfect royalty
Made His home in me

To the One who holds the stars
We lift You higher, we lift You higher
To the One who holds our hearts
There is no other
There is no other like You

King of endless life
Yet You chose to die
On a sinner's tree
Exposed for me

With one final breath
It is finished
Stormed the gates of hell
Ripping through the veil

To the One who overcame
We lift You higher, we lift You higher
To the Name above all Names
There is no other
There is no other

We lift You higher, we lift You higher

"Take Me Home, Country Roads",John Denver,"Almost heaven, West Virginia, Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
Life is old there, older than the trees, younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze

Country roads, take me home to the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma, take me home, country roads

All my memories gather round her, miner's lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky, misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye

Country roads, take me home to the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma, take me home, country roads

I hear her voice in the morning hour, she calls me, the radio reminds me of my home far away
And driving down the road I get a feeling that I should have been home yesterday, yesterday

Country roads, take me home to the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma, take me home, country roads

Country roads, take me home to the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma, take me home, country roads

Take me home, down country roads
Take me home, down country roads"
It's My Life,Bon Jovi,"This ain't a song for the broken-hearted
No silent prayer for the faith-departed
I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
You're gonna hear my voice
When I shout it out loud

It's my life
It's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said,
""I did it my way.""
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life

This is for the ones who stood their ground
For Tommy and Gina who never backed down
Tomorrow's getting harder make no mistake
Luck ain't even lucky
Got to make your own breaks

It's my life
And it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said,
""I did it my way.""
I just want to live while I'm alive
'Cause it's my life

Better stand tall when they're calling you out
Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down

It's my life
And it's now or never
'Cause I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said,
""I did it my way.""
I just want to live while I'm alive

It's my life
And it's now or never
'Cause I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said,
""I did it my way.""
I just want to live while I'm alive
'Cause it's my life!"
Bohemian Rhapsody,Panic! At The Disco,"Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality

Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go
Little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away

Mama, ooh
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on
As if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sent shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth

Mama, ooh
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouette of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning
Very, very frightening me
(Galileo) Galileo
(Galileo) Galileo
Galileo Figaro
Magnifico

I'm just a poor boy
Nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy
From a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity

Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go (Let him go!)
Bismillah! We will not let you go (Let him go!)
Bismillah! We will not let you go (Let me go!)
Will not let you go (Let me go!)
Never, never let you go
Never let me go, oh
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh, mama mia, mama mia (Mama mia, let me go)
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, you can't do this to me, baby
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here

(oh, yeah, oh, yeah)

Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me

Anyway the wind blows"
E.D.K.H.,Upchurch,"Tell 'em what's up fuggin'
Woo, yeah
Fuckin' cornbread Conner over there 'bout to fuckin' sling some mud boe

Fuck 'em all, got a goose in my glovebox
I'm wearin' Ariat's and I don't even wear socks
I tell them boys in the fancy ol' truck, hook 'em up
Square body when I fuckin' square up (Woo)
Boot scootin' buggy in my knee cap jeans
You got a gun but you're scared of me
I be on a beat and I don't even grow no tomatoes
You can't touch me like a really hot ass potato (Woo)
Walk around with my neck muscles flexed out
Pocket full of money and some goddamn rainbow trout
Fuck fishin' license I don't need that
Hit the game warden smack dab in his little gonads
I'm lit'r than a truck on fire, swervin'
Hotter than a distillery full of bourbon
Nice twenty-two by fourteens, I hope you curb 'em
Get some bullet holes, son-of-bitches, do you some learnin', fuggin'
Mountain Dew-Dew on the haters like a commode
Deliver Bigfoot dust, that's why I go beast mode
And they ain't gonna catch me, camera man too slow
To be redneck'r than me, there ain't no loophole
Pullin' up leakin' oil 'cause I'm slicker
I must be a Husqvarna, I'm a tad big thicker
Got a tootsie pop shawty, all I wanna do is lick her
I go hard, not even my own pecker is stiffer
I got a friend with a mullet, a friend with a musket
A friend with a chicken and some corn in a bucket
Every time I see wood all I wanna do is chuck it
Bonfire bigger than a rich guys house, fuggin'
Rubber baby buggy bumpers, Alan Jackson thumpin' in my uncle brother's Hummer
Dip stains on my steerin' wheel and all my covers
Santa Clause doesn't know but Rudolf got it comin'
Last year I asked for a '58 Biscayne
All I got was an orange and a pack of ROGAINE
You give me all that coal, you ain't give me propane
Now I got beef, I'm about to steal your sleigh
I listen to country music even when I sleep
I walk it like I talk it, I got boots in my teeth
My station wagon got a Jesus fish
Cut fender wells on 40's, bitch
Big lift kit 'cause I'm closer to God
Plus he gave me a ding-dong the size of an Eddie Bauer rod
Skeet shootin' with some buddies from my hometown
Pistol packin' that kaboom when we go downtown
'Cause the weirdos on the corner look like sewer rats
Seen a dude in plaid shorts shit his pants, that's a fuckin' fact
I wasn't even high, I ain't even drink Jack
But that fella who pooped prolly coulda used a tater sack
Eww diarrhea in his Air Force 1's
If he was wearin' Tony Lamas it wouldn't have happened to him
Alright back to the cool shit, like I was sayin'
I want a mullet so long that it touches the pavement
I need a Dukes of Hazard car so I can smash all the Daisys
But like not the cousin ones, I mean like non-blood related
Bitch I'm Lacquer Thinner Larry, sweeter than a blackberry
Bald-ass head but my nipples still hella hairy
Lookin' like a dreamcatcher on a set of man titties
I'm a country boy, I don't fuck with the city (Yeah)
Yeah, I'm a country boy, Morgan Wallen on the speakers
Ridin' through town steady wakin' up the tweekers
Lacquer

Tell 'em what it is Bench Seat Bobby
Guns, moonshine, and weed's all you need, boe
Might be a little dust on this bottle fuggin'

Slim note Jimmy though I drink like Buffett
I've been chillin' with the bitches, 'bout a couple hundred dozen
They pour the Jim Beam all up in my gullet
Tryna get me drunk so they can play with my mullet
Ridin' in the Camry son, I rip the E-brake
Take it to the curb slidin' sideways (Skrrt)
Then I turn it around and I take it back to my place
Put her ass on the couch then we hit a three way, woah (Damn)
Bitch I'm patriotic, bleed red, white, and blue
If you ain't about this country well motherfuck you
Your cousin hit me up, I nutted, cashew
Think I caught something, hold up, *ah choo*
Ain't nothin', ain't muckin', I stay Sam Huntin'
Skinny jeans with Cope rings on you fake motherfuckers
Big shit and big rigs rather be like truckers
Lift kits and bit tits, eat a bitch like supper
I hide my face so the Clintons can't find me
Next day you'll find me suicided from a pine tree
I turn around to see what's behind me
A fat booty chick, plump lips, a dime piece (A huge bitch)
I'm here, I'm there, elf on the shelf
Got bars by the load tucked under my belt
Tongue kissin' your bitch, dick her down then she melt
One more thing, Epstein didn't kill himself

Nobody Loves Me Like You,Chris Tomlin,"Morning
I see you in the sunrise every morning
It's like a picture that you've painted for me
A love letter in the sky

Story
I could've had a really different story
But you came down from heaven to restore me
Forever saved my life

Nobody loves me like you love me Jesus
I stand in awe of your amazing ways
I worship you as long as I am breathing
God you are faithful and true
Nobody loves me like you

Mountains
You're breaking down the weight of all my mountains
Even when it feels like I'm surrounded
You never leave my side

Nobody loves me like you love me Jesus
I stand in awe of your amazing ways
I worship you as long as I am breathing
God you are faithful and true
Nobody loves me like you

Oh what a song to sing
Oh what a song to sing
Oh what a song to sing
Oh what a song my heart keeps singing
Oh what a song to sing
Oh what a song to sing
Oh what a song to sing
Jesus you love me
And I love you God

Nobody loves me like you love me Jesus
I stand in awe of your amazing ways
I worship you as long as I am breathing
God I will worship you
Forever worship you

Beautiful In White,Westlife,"Not sure if you know this
But when we first met
I got so nervous I couldn't speak

In that very moment
I found the one and
My life had found its missing piece

So as long as I live I'll love you
Will have and hold you
You look so beautiful in white
And from now to my very last breath
This day I'll cherish
You look so beautiful in white
Tonight

What we have is timeless
My love is endless
And with this ring I say to the world

You're my every reason
You're all that I believe in
With all my heart I mean every word

So as long as I live I'll love you
Will have and hold you
You look so beautiful in white
And from now to my very last breath
This day I'll cherish
You look so beautiful in white
Tonight

You look so beautiful in white
So beautiful in white
Tonight

And if our daughter's what our future holds
I hope she has your eyes
Finds love like you and I did
But when she falls in love we'll let her go
I'll walk her down the aisle
She'll look so beautiful in white

You look so beautiful in white

So as long as I live I'll love you
Will have and hold you
You look so beautiful in white
And from now to my very last breath
This day I'll cherish
You look so beautiful in white
Tonight

You look so beautiful in white

Diamond Heart,Alan Walker & Sophia Somajo,"Hello, sweet grief
I know you will be the death of me
Feel like the morning after ecstasy
I am drowning in an endless sea

Hello, old friend
Here's the misery that knows no end
So I'm doing everything I can
To make sure I never love again

I wish that I did not know
Where all broken lovers go
I wish that my heart was made of stone
Yeah, if I was bulletproof
I'd love you black and blue
If I was solid like a jewel

If I had a diamond heart
Oh, oh
I'd give you all my love
If I was unbreakable
If I had a diamond heart
Oh, oh
You could shoot me with a gun of gold
If I was unbreakable

I'd walk straight through the bullet
Bend like a tulip
Blue-eyed and foolish
Never mind the bruises
Into the fire
Breakin' through the wires
Give you all I've got

(If I had a diamond heart)
I'd walk straight through the dagger
Never break the pattern
Diamonds don't shatter
Beautiful and battered
Into the poison
Cry you an ocean
Give you all I've got

Goodbye, so long
I don't know if this is right or wrong
Am I giving up where I belong?
'Cause every station is playing our song

Goodbye, my love
You are everything my dreams made of
You'll be Prince and I'm the crying dove
If I only were unbreakable

I wish that I did not know
Where all broken lovers go
I wish that my heart was made of stone
Yeah, if I was bulletproof
I'd love you black and blue
If I was solid like a jewel

If I had a diamond heart
Oh, oh
I'd give you all my love
If I was unbreakable
If I had a diamond heart
Oh, oh
You can shoot me with a gun of gold
If I was unbreakable

I'd walk straight through the bullet
Bend like a tulip
Blue-eyed and foolish
Never mind the bruises
Into the fire
Breakin' through the wires
Give you all I've got

Wish You The Best,Lecrae,"[Lecrae:]
Listen, look, I see you on IG
Your little man so big now
See you move to the west coast, and you done copped yourself a crib now
I'm sure by now you've moved on
I mean it's been some years since I left you in your bedroom wiping tears
I disappeared after I had met your momma now
And you met all my family too
They told us ""love was complicated""
We told them ""we gon' make it through""
But I blew it, I missed it, I didn't make you Mrs., I just made you misses
I didn't put no ring on yo finger, but I did put you through the ringer
Yeah, I own that
Wish I could go back
Treat you right take and take my wrongs back
And you should know that I

I wish you all the love you could imagine
And I wish you everything that never happened

[Verse Simmonds:]
I wish you luck
I wish you love
I wish you everything, everything that you ever dreamed of
I wish you life
I wish you joy
I wish you everything, everything a girl would want
I wish you the best
I know I'm the worst
You deserve the best
That's what you deserve

[Lecrae:]
Yeah, yeah, now how we get this far?
Everything escalated
Late nights talkin' on the phone
Even with my situation, I'm so taken
But either way, I called you when you hit back
And we talked through all my dark times and you told me to just kick back
Lay on your shoulders
Know we friends but we closer
Thought that this could never work but I kept on walking that road
Maybe reconsider everything
Tell my girl we'll prolly never make it to the wedding day
I might not be ready, man
Oh, left her at the altar
Pretty sure I scarred her
And I hope that Heaven called her
And I wish I never falter

And I wish her every joy she could imagine
And I wish you everything that never happened

[Verse Simmonds:]
I wish you luck
I wish you love
I wish you everything, everything that you ever dreamed of
I wish you life
I wish you joy
I wish you everything, everything a girl would want
I wish you the best
I know I'm the worst
You deserve the best
That's what you deserve

[Lecrae:]
I know, I know I'm the reason you stopped believin' in love
'Cause the man I was that left you needin' more than I could ever be then
Crazy how everything's changed
Married now, I'm in a new space
And I heard you moved upstate
Well, I wish you the best always

[Verse Simmonds:]
I wish you luck
I wish you love
I wish you everything, everything that you ever dreamed of
I wish you life
I wish you joy
I wish you everything, everything a girl would want
I wish you the best"
Outro,Majid Jordan,"But I had to throw it all away

And, I gave, I gave your love away
I said I love you, baby
And, I, I gave your love away
I said I love you, baby
And, I, I gave your love away
I said I love you

Almost quit on myself
It felt like it was over

But I had to throw it all away
I said I love you, baby
And, I, I gave your love away
I said I love you, baby
And, I gave, I gave your love away
I said I love you, baby
And, I, I gave your love away
I said I love you, baby
And, I, I gave your love away
I said I love you"

City sprawlin’ with soldiers on war horses
With chest armor armed forces for official employers

‘Cause job shortage makes some rob to recoup losses
Full equipped with gods on high cliffs
Bombs from drone ships, it’s lightning from Zeus’ fist
18 A-list VIP as it gets
‘Cause pirate computer mix worth a trillion bits
2016, rulers with big dreams
One world, one Roman government, one currency
One slave populace from one goddess' ovaries
One love motherfucker and it ain’t for you or me
Totalitarian, barbarian
Motherfucker this is Rome say the name again
You got a favorite sin? Go commit it then

Meet me there..."
Runaway Train,Jamie N Commons & Skylar Grey,"Call you up in the middle of the night
Like a firefly without a light
You were there like a blowtorch burning
I was a key that could use a little turning

So tired that I couldn't even sleep
So many secrets I couldn't keep
Promised myself I wouldn't weep
One more promise I couldn't keep

It seems no one can help me now
I'm in too deep, there's no way out
This time I have really lead myself astray

Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Can you help me remember how to smile?
Make it somehow all seem worthwhile
How on earth did I get so jaded?
Life's mysteries seem so faded

I can go where no one else can go
I know what no one else knows
Here I am, just drowning in the rain
With a ticket for a runaway train

Everything seems cut and dry
Day and night, earth and sky
Somehow I just don't believe it

Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

(Somehow I'm neither here nor there)

Bought a ticket for a runaway train
Like a madman laughing at the rain
A little out of touch, a little insane
It's just easier than dealing with the pain

Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Runaway train never coming back
Runaway train tearing up the track
Runaway train burning in my veins
I run away but it always seems the same"
The Gambler,Johnny Cash,"About twenty years ago
On a train bound for nowhere
I met up with The Gambler
We were both too tired to sleep
So we took turns a starin'
Through the window at the darkness
'Til boredom overtook us
And he commenced to speak

He said, 'Son, I've made a life
Out of readin' people's faces
And knowin' what their cards were
By the way they held their eyes
And if you don't mind my sayin'
I would say you're out of aces
And for one taste of your whiskey
I will give you some advice'

So I handed him my bottle
And he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette
Then he bummed a light
The night got deathly quiet
And his face lost all expression
He said, 'If you're gonna play the game, boy
You better learn to play it right'

'Cause ev'ry gambler knows
That the secret to survival
Is knowin' what to throw away
And knowin' what to keep
And ev'ry hand's a winner
Just like ev'ry hand's a loser
And the best that you can hope for
Is to die in your sleep.

You got to know when to hold 'em
Know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away
Know when to run
You don't ever count your money
While you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin'
When the dealin' is done

You got to know when to hold 'em
Know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away
Know when to run
You don't ever count your money
While you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin'
When the dealin' is done

And when he finished speakin'
He turned back t'ward the window
Put out his cigarette
Faded off to sleep
And somewhere in the darkness
The gambler he broke even
But in his final words
I found an ace that I could keep

You got to know when to hold 'em
Know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away
Know when to run
You don't ever count your money
While you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin'
When the dealin' is done

You got to know when to hold 'em
Know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away
Know when to run
You don't ever count your money
While you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin'
When the dealin' is done

You got to know when to hold 'em
Know when to fold 'em

What up? My sister and them, All my niggas listening
I be one and done’ing hoes like Crawford at Michigan
Realest nigga told you that, Cloey love me more than rap
Bitch I got that Kobe game, bitch you got that Kobe rap
DMV we on the map, it’s over for these corny niggas
Wicked ambition go give this shit a coroner visit
There’s no answer for it, these rhetorical lyrics
Talking ridiculous have mommas getting floral opinions
I’m on one, we on weed but she on E
She so fly, she so fine, but she so shy but I’m a don see?
No car key and I mean that
Cause I show fur, no bikini wax
My Moschino that fire, bet you never seen that
Swear this closet full of heat, bitch I never need a match
Undefeated, GS in a t-shirt and my Leaders hat
Change of scenery, I’m Al Pacino Willy Beaman yeah
Turned into a shark and I got that from all this DC crap
Fuck yo bitch to The Weeknd, I ain’t speaking bout that CD player
But shout to that OVO, Shout out to the whole T.O
Shout YMCMB, MMG we run the globe
This the district where politicians is fucking goons
And I done seen some old beefs make a bunch of news
A neutral mover, truly cool with a bunch of crews
Better keep a shooter, there’s always one with something to prove
Nice for that war, trying to see my daughter walk
Keep wifey in La Perla and don’t you ask her what that tori cost
Always keep a dodie on on me, I ain’t for that Maury talk
A 40 of that OE, Casey Veggie my homie
Out in LA I'm fakin’ hitting switches
This ain’t mine, it’s Ricky, but shhh don’t tell my bitches
I swear I love my music, I truthfully hate this business
I swear it’s like this liquor is improving a lot of women
Intuitively and gifted, Too empty, this is Lipton
Hallucinating from Rufilin, Who is saying is iller?
Nigga, I got that Dilla, Premo, Swizzy flow
Women front, they get its cold
She never play no games with me so I never get her Coach
I’m supposed to boast, this lyrical overdose
Niggas George Foreman grillin’, shit I spit that rope-a-dope
She be sliding on the pole, slide down and roll my smoke
White boys gon set the mood, yeah, that’s word to Hall & Oates
And it’s still fuck everybody
I run the Summer, don’t plan on sharing potties
Shoutout yo baby momma, that bitch is sorta fine
That yellow bitch, a lot of face, she that emoticon
Got a bunch of haters, but I got more to count
Mohammed got a little mac, don’t get your shoulder popped
I don’t really know a lot, but I hope these people know my heart
My Nomo could be found in stores with a jersey only Nomo got
Konichiwa, shadow chain and decent watch
If I’m getting geechy I can rock three chains on either block
DC maybe PG MMG shit please do understand it
The only team more powerful? Sasha and Malia family
Malia family, We the family
I give these bitches my seed, swear they don’t need a nanny
Won’t see me in the Phantom til a nigga see a Grammy"
Guiltless,Dodie Clark,"There is a wall in my life built by you (Mmm)
You opened a door that a kid shouldn't walk through
Oh, but I'm not bitter, I'm just tired
No use getting angry at the way that you're wired
Ignorant trauma in one afternoon

And I could never let you know (Ooh you'd never get it)
And now I'm the one who can't let go (Ooh don't say it's genetic)

Is it real? You believe you're guiltless
Oh, I can tell you believe you're guiltless
But I don't think I'd feel better if I opened your eyes
I'll carry your burden 'til the day that you die
Is it real? You believe you're guiltless
(Mmm)

I'll never know why you favour that tone (Mmm)
Not one shred of hope so I built up my own
Oh, but I'm not bitter, I'm just tired
No use getting angry at the way that you're wired
A dark politician will end up alone

And I could never let you know (Ooh you'd never get it)
And now I'm the one who can't let go (Ooh don't say it's genetic)

Is it real? You believe you're guiltless
Oh, I can tell you believe you're guiltless
But I don't think I'd feel better if I opened your eyes
I'll carry your burden 'til the day that you die
Is it real? You believe you're guiltless
(Mmm)

I'm not bitter, I'm just tired
No use getting angry at the way that you're wired
(I'm not bitter, I'm just tired)
I could never let you know (Ooh)
(No use getting angry at the way that you're wired)
Is it real? You believe you're guiltless
(I'm not bitter, I'm just tired)
(No use getting angry at the way that you're wired)
Ooh ooh
'Til the day that you die
I'm not bitter, I'm just tired
No use getting angry at the way that you're wired
(I'm not bitter, I'm just tired)
(No use getting angry at the way that you're wired)
Is it real? You believe you're guiltless
(I'm not bitter, I'm just tired)
(No use getting angry at the way that you're wired)
Is it real? You believe you're guiltless
'Til the day that you die
(I'm not bitter, I'm just tired)
(No use getting angry at the way that you're wired)
Is it real? You believe you're guiltless
'Til the day that you die
(I'm not bitter, I'm just tired)

Monster,Dodie,"Tell me again about how it hurts
Being awfully loud for an introvert
Get out of my room
Smile wiped clean
Isn't it weird to be so mean?

I'm guessing that I've grown horns
I guess I'm human no more
I can tell I've rotted in your brain
Oh, how easily passion twists
You think I'm a crazy bitch
I craft my words to fit your head
'Cause no one listens to the dead

So maybe I will talk to you
The only way I know how to
Mmm, mmm, I've said my speech
Mmm, mmm, through sharpened teeth
You break the rules and spikes grow from your skin
Please let the devil in

A meter apart
You blankly stare
We shout in our heads
Are you still in there?
Well this ends bad, then
We knew it would
So we won't eat our words
'Cause they don't taste good

I'm guessing that I've grown horns
I guess I'm human no more
I can tell I've rotted in your brain
Oh, how easily passion twists
You think I'm a crazy bitch
A thousand words are left unsaid
'Cause no one listens to the dead

So maybe I will talk to you
The only way I know how to
Mmm, mmm, I've said my speech
Mmm, mmm, through sharpened teeth
You break the rules and spikes grow from your skin

I think it might be worth a try
Oh
Am I ready to let this die?
Mmm, mmm, a monster's here
Mmm, mmm, you plug your ears
But hey, you might just listen to it sing
Please let the devil in

(We won't eat our words / They don't taste so good)
(You've said your speech through sharpened teeth)

Look, I know that I've seen this before
High and mighty, at the top of your list
Adoring every move, now my rank is sinking
But we're both guilty of black or white thinking
And through my red eyes, you look pale
All of your scars are looking more like scales
Two ugly creatures, two sinister preachers
Blind to the past, like a couple of monsters;
Just a couple of monsters!

So maybe I will talk to you
The only way I know how to
Mmm, mmm, you've said your speech
Mmm, mmm, through sharpened teeth
You break the rules and spikes grow from your skin

Oh
I think it might be worth a try
Oh
Am I ready to let this die?
Mmm, mmm, a monster's here
Mmm, mmm, you plug your ears
But hey, you might just listen to it sing
Please let the devil in

(We won't eat our words)
(They don't taste so good)
(We won't eat our words)
(They don't taste so good)"

Endless Alleluia,Bethel Music,"In the morning when I rise to meet You
In the morning when I lift my eyes
You're the gentle light that falls around me
You're the first thought on my mind

Let our voices rise
All creation cries
Singing out an endless alleluia
From this moment on
Join with Heaven's song
Singing out an endless alleluia

In the moments where You go unnoticed
In the ordinary day to day
Countless miracles of life around us
Point like arrows to Your name

Let our voices rise
All creation cries
Singing out an endless alleluia
From this moment on
Join with Heaven's song
Singing out an endless alleluia

Only a moment to live this life
Like shooting stars burning up the night
Till Heaven's opened and we arrive
In Your presence, Lord
In Your presence

Only a moment to live this life
Like shooting stars burning up the night
Till Heaven's opened and we arrive
In Your presence, Lord
In Your presence

Let our voices rise
All creation cries
Singing out an endless alleluia
From this moment on
Join with Heaven's song
Singing out an endless alleluia

There's nothing better, there's nothing better
There's nothing better than this right now
There's nothing better, there's nothing better
There's nothing better than this right now

In the evening when I lay my head down
In the evening when I close my eyes
You're still the only One I wanna cling to
You're the last thought on my mind"
none,none,none
