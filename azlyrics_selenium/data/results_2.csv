King Of Kings,Hillsong Worship,"In the darkness
We were waiting
Without hope
Without light
Till from heaven
You came running
There was mercy in Your eyes
To fulfil the law and prophets
To a virgin came the word
From a throne of endless glory
To a cradle in the dirt

Praise the Father
Praise the Son
Praise the Spirit
Three in one
God of glory
Majesty
Praise forever to the King of Kings

To reveal the kingdom coming
And to reconcile the lost
To redeem the whole creation
You did not despise the cross
For even in your suffering
You saw to the other side
Knowing this was our salvation
Jesus for our sake you died

Praise the Father
Praise the Son
Praise the Spirit
Three in one
God of glory
Majesty
Praise forever to the King of Kings

And the morning that You rose
All of heaven held its breath
Till that stone was moved for good
For the Lamb had conquered death
And the dead rose from their tombs
And the angels stood in awe
For the souls of all who'd come
To the Father are restored
And the church of Christ was born
Then the Spirit lit the flame
Now this gospel truth of old
Shall not kneel
Shall not faint
By His blood and in His name
In His freedom I am free
For the love of Jesus Christ
Who has resurrected me

Praise the Father
Praise the Son
Praise the Spirit
Three in one
God of glory
Majesty
Praise forever to the King of Kings

Praise the Father
Praise the Son
Praise the Spirit
Three in one
God of glory
Majesty
Praise forever to the King of Kings"
Tell The World,Hillsong United,"Don't want to stand here and shout Your praise
And walk away and forget Your Name
I'll stand for you if it's all I do
Cause there is none that compare to You

Cause all I want in this lifetime is You
And all i want in this whole world is you

Tell the world that Jesus lives
Tell the world that, tell the world that
Tell the world that he died for them
Tell the world that he lives again

No longer I but Christ in me
Cause it's the truth that set me free
How could this world be a better place?
But by thy mercy and by thy grace

C'mon, c'mon we'll tell the world about You
C'mon, c'mon we'll tell the world about You

Tell the world that Jesus lives
Tell the world that, tell the world that
Tell the world that he died for them
Tell the world that he lives again

C'mon, c'mon we'll tell the world about You
Tell the world that
Tell the world that
C'mon, c'mon we'll tell the world about You
Tell the world that
Tell the world that
About You"

Reckless Love,Cory Asbury,"Before I spoke a word, You were singing over me
You have been so, so good to me
Before I took a breath, You breathed Your life in me
You have been so, so kind to me

Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God
Oh, it chases me down, fights 'til I'm found, leaves the ninety-nine
I couldn't earn it, and I don't deserve it, still, You give Yourself away
Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God

When I was Your foe, still Your love fought for me
You have been so, so good to me
When I felt no worth, You paid it all for me
You have been so, so kind to me

Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God
Oh, it chases me down, fights 'til I'm found, leaves the ninety-nine
I couldn't earn it, and I don't deserve it, still, You give Yourself away
Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God, yeah

There's no shadow You won't light up
Mountain You won't climb up
Coming after me
There's no wall You won't kick down
Lie You won't tear down
Coming after me

There's no shadow You won't light up
Mountain You won't climb up
Coming after me
There's no wall You won't kick down
Lie You won't tear down
Coming after me

Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God
Oh, it chases me down, fights 'til I'm found, leaves the ninety-nine
And I couldn't earn it, I don't deserve it, still, You give Yourself away
Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God"
What A Beautiful Name,Hillsong Worship,"You were the Word at the beginning
One with God the Lord Most High
Your hidden glory in creation
Now revealed in You our Christ

What a beautiful Name it is
What a beautiful Name it is
The Name of Jesus Christ my King

What a beautiful Name it is
Nothing compares to this
What a beautiful Name it is
The Name of Jesus

You didn't want heaven without us
So Jesus, You brought heaven down
My sin was great, Your love was greater
What could separate us now

What a wonderful Name it is
What a wonderful Name it is
The Name of Jesus Christ my King

What a wonderful Name it is
Nothing compares to this
What a wonderful Name it is
The Name of Jesus
What a wonderful Name it is
The Name of Jesus

Death could not hold You, the veil tore before You
You silenced the boast of sin and grave
The heavens are roaring the praise of Your glory
For You are raised to life again

You have no rival, You have no equal
Now and forever, God, You reign
Yours is the Kingdom, Yours is the glory
Yours is the Name above all names

What a powerful Name it is
What a powerful Name it is
The Name of Jesus Christ my King

What a powerful Name it is
Nothing can stand against
What a powerful Name it is
The Name of Jesus

A Great Big World (Say Something),Futuristic,"[Hook - Jerrin Jaramillo:]
Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'll be the one if you want me to
And anywhere I would've followed you
And say something, I'm giving up on you

[Verse - Futuristic:]
A lot of stress, she was a mess and I cleaned it up
You needed stuff and I needed something a little different
Say something, say anything, make a face, hold my hand
Kiss my lips to show that you really is committed
Four years is a lot of time, should we dismiss it?
Forget it and live as if it never existed
Emotions, I'm hopeless, it came to grow consistent
Turned a friendship into love, but now that love is sort of distant
I never thought I'd see the day I couldn't make you laugh
Couldn't make you smile, couldn't even make you mad
It's kind of like you're a cast or a mold
Or something from the past that I used to have
I'd do anything to get you back
And you would do anything just to get me back
I guess that's how it is
They say it's better to have loved and lost
But now I feel lost and I don't wanna live
Say something, say that you forgive me
Tell me that you believe me
Have faith that we can make it, I know that it won't be easy
But we could find a way back into that passion
Feel the word love and get lost in the meaning
Put you before me, your wants and your needs
My dreams include every bit of you
I wouldn't say it if it wasn't true
All you gotta do is tell me that you love me too
Say something

[Hook - Jerrin Jaramillo:]
Say something, I'm giving up on you
And I will swallow my pride
You're the one that I love
And I'm saying goodbye
And say something, I'm giving up on you
I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
And anywhere I would've followed you
And say something, I'm giving up on you
Say something, I'm giving up on you
Say something"
2nd Guess,Emily King,"I'll be the one to love you when there's no one else around
Be the one to hold you when the others let you down
I know it sounds crazy, I know we just met
Life is always sweeter when there's no regrets

We can plan a holiday somewhere nice and warm
I can be your everything, shelter from the storm
Yeah, there's something 'bout ya, it's hard to forget
Life is always sweeter when there's no regrets

Oh why, why not take chances?
Oh why can't we let these hearts go?
This could be a moment, something worth holding onto
Oh why miss a connection?
Oh why don't we listen when we both know
This is something special, and I don't wanna think it through
There's no second-guessing you

I can make you happy, never ever sad
Never ever treat you like you're not the best
Did somebody hurt you? Drag your heart around?
I can lift you up if you let your guard down

Tell me all your secrets, I'll tell you all my crimes
Start with the confession, then toss it all aside
Oh, there's something 'bout you that's hard to forget
Life is always sweeter when there's no regrets

Oh why, why not take chances?
Oh why can't we let these hearts go?
This could be a moment, something worth holding onto
Oh why miss a connection?
Oh why don't we listen when we both know
This is something special, and I don't wanna think it through
No second-guessing you

I take my chances when they find me
(No thinking twice, thinking twice, got to roll the dice now)
I've seen too many fall behind me
I don't wanna lose you right now, oh-ooh

Oh why, why not take chances?
Oh why don't we listen when we both know
This is something special, and I don't wanna think it through"

Touch Of Heaven (Live Acoustic),Hillsong Worship,"How I live for the moments

Be undone by who You are
My desire is to know You deeper

Throw my fears into the wind
I am desperate for a touch of heaven

Tell me what you really like
Baby I can take my time
We don't ever have to fight
Just take it step-by-step
I can see it in your eyes
Cause they never tell me lies
I can feel that body shake
And the heat between your legs

Paris In The Rain,Lauv,"All I know is
We could go anywhere, we could do
Anything, girl, whatever the mood we're in
Yeah, all I know is
Getting lost late at night under stars
Finding love standing right where we are
Your lips, they pull me in the moment
You and I alone and
People may be watching, I don't mind

'Cause anywhere with you feels right
Anywhere with you feels like Paris in the rain, Paris in the rain
We don't need a fancy town or bottles that we can't pronounce
'Cause anywhere babe is like Paris in the rain
When I'm with you, when I'm with you
Paris in the rain, Paris in the rain

I look at you now and I want this forever
I might not deserve it but there's nothing better
Don't know how I ever did it all without you
My heart is about to, about to jump out of my chest
Feelings, they come and they go, that they do
Feelings, they come and they go, not with you
The late nights and the street lights and the people
Look at me girl and the whole world could stop

Anywhere with you feels right
Anywhere with you feels like Paris in the rain, Paris in the rain
We don't need a fancy town or bottles that we can't pronounce
'Cause anywhere babe is like Paris in the rain
When I'm with you, when I'm with you
Paris in the rain, Paris in the rain, oh

Girl when I'm not with you
All I do is miss you
So come and set the mood right underneath the moonlight
Days in Paris, nights in Paris
Paint you with my eyes closed
Wonder where the time goes
(Isn't it obvious?)
(Isn't it obvious?)
So come and set the mood right underneath the moonlight

'Cause anywhere with you feel right
Anywhere with you feels like Paris in the rain, Paris in the rain
Walking down an empty street
Puddles underneath our feet"
Have You Ever Seen The Rain,Rod Stewart,"Someone told me long ago
There's a calm before the storm,
I know;
It's been comin' for some time.
When it's over, so they say,
It'll rain a sunny day,
I know;
Shinin' down like water.

[Chorus:]
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain
Comin' down on a sunny day?

Yesterday, and days before,
Sun is cold and rain is hard,
I know;
Been that way for all my time.
'Til forever, on it goes
Through the circle, fast and slow,
I know;
It can't stop, I wonder.

[Chorus]

Yeah!

Bet You Won't,Chamillionaire,"I bet you won't
I bet you won't
I bet you, I bet you, I bet you, I bet you

Man these rappers ain't saying nothing
Every verse is a damn lie
Your position is pro voice
My position is anti
Swear they tellin these stories to you
These rappers full of that mantie
Can't stop me they can try
But I'm winning up by that landslide

Y'all worse than that tie tanning
Get a ship but it won't sail
Y'all posting on snitchagram
Why you saying you don't tell
These boys they got no stamps
They don't really touch no mail
I'm still trying to get super poster
Still fill up under her oh well

All talking like he the man
Y'all softer than Peter Pan
So many fish in my fishtank
And my crib she talking about eating in
Call me up sure be to spend
Got money treating pass me your lamb
Play me hoe we won't meet again
And my knuckles probably gonna beat your chin

Get it off for my plan A
Never needed that B row
I ain't never even shed a tear
When anybody ever said peace out
Made a hit with my freestyles
They ain't talking about free now
They always told me that money talks
So I always got it on speed dial

I'm trying to work she trying to play
Treat the bank just like a hotter wave
And I'm showing up just like a holiday
But I'm back to work I'm not trying to stay
My money day is my kind of day
Very large is my kind of pay
Tell avado I'm not the best
I bet he was fond of you cayate

Wonder why I'm ahead of them
Talking down then I ended them
They try to say that they on your side
But switch back and forth just like pendulums
Bought your strap and extended 'em
New cars when they rented them
Our old schools look so cool
That you probably thought we invented them

Steal a heart but I'm not thief
Star snatching is so weak
You ain't gotta thank me for it
Just show respect to my OG
I drop it off in your OD
Veteran but I'm cold beat
They keep saying I don't drop
So might drop another in 4 weeks

Chamilitary go so beast
Freestyle on your beats
Gotta take it out of my 2 hands
And that's the reason it don't leak
2 businesses out of state
No card that's out of date
I've been stuntin on 'em since '98
If you tryin' to hate then you kinda late

Hit Brazil and take frequent trips
Groupies all on that freaky tip
Say goodnight and then take a flight
When I disappear you can't keep a chip
Let me tell you how deep it get
This is more about keeping it
Take a pocket then strippen it
Then I put the profit down deep in it

Your girl talking about orgies
Rather go get more G's
Duplicate how I rep the state
We need less of them and need more of me
Spit a verse then it's for a free
Tryin to do it before hopefully
No trick or treat in my clickazie
And I'm feeling like it's your boy D

Sip patrone while they copy
Call me up and say papi
Knowing that I might store so they tryna
Block me like we play hockey
Pocket got me like Gretzky
Where the hell is my SB
I use sandboat to that paper
Going go and tell them come catch me

Don't talk about financials
Tell me what your man do
Unless you got your own dough
And you make enough cash to brag to
Hope your rent ain't pass due
Hope your shape is natural
Can't say you're a model
Even if that shit was in your bathroom

Why everybody got to be the same
Every group got to be a game
Every rapper got to be a rapper
And every rapper got to be a lame
Love my jewelry that's cool
She gonna catch a bad flu
But if my wrist ain't sick enough
Then my whip gonna make her hat you

Everything happen for a purpose
Obvious they didn't mean your verses
Every verse that y'all spit is worthless
And they couldn't pay me to give you a purchase
Every verse they say Cham is ripping
Say it's false if they tell you different
I'm still a Jordan grand and a Pippen
Up man your scripts don't have me trippin"
when the party's over,Lewis Capaldi,"Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleeding
But nothing ever stops you leaving

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer
And I'll call you when the party's over

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

But nothing is better, sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own"
No Tears,Rilès,"I ain't got no one to fear
I ain't impressed anymore
I don't see but I feel
Sour energy brought me there
Search into you and the paper's gon fill up itself
So fuck if you curse when I flex
Fuck I'm not kind and stupid, better serve me respect
I think I'm good at feeling bad
Don't be too nice when scavengers are ready to bounce
I picture plans in my head
Darker than Dinka
Venom pushing up my edges
I won't let dirt on my name
Do it for fun
'Front of me bitch you bargain
I ain't got a lot to sing
Still alive just for the hate that I hate, bitch
You gon' remember the name
Jungle ain't shit when you're beaten all over again
Smoking the shine in my eyes and I'm left with some apeshit
Enlighten but thoughts are the darkest
Wildin' everywhere but in the jungle
Come to R city we 'bout to fuck the freckles of your face
In you flaws you don't wanna, wanna
Racing against myself faster, faster
If I slow down it's the ganja, ganja
If I fuck up it's the karma, karma

No tears falling down my eyes
No fear left into my mind
All this evil turned me blind
I need to run towards the light
No tears falling down my eyes
No fear left into my mind
All this evil turned me blind
I need to run towards the light

Promise me you won't be falling
Say to me you are my greatest opponent
I keep the backbone solid
Tahia Djazaïr
Baba grew up in the sand and the mountains
Fuck what you heard if you hear what you're saying
Didn't like my song
You said ""this shit's amazing""
I'm tired of the Yes-men
I'm tired of the Yasminas
Tired of the elephantshit I see

Ouh skibidibam
Back in her pussy it has been while (while)
Ouh shaking new hands
Fucking new bitches and making new songs (muy bien)
Ouh back and I run
Feel like my libido me never done
Why you keep on running when your legs already broken?

Now I'm putting down the 'juana
Back to the hagla
Is you really? I said kinda
Pray that my sins never come back
Bypass the drama
Look ain't no blood on my contracts
And imma dance like a warrior
Salam hyenas
You cannot switch off the phoenix
This ain't no threat but my simple statement
Welcome to the jungle Rilès vs Satan

No tears falling down my eyes
No fear left into my mind
All this evil turned me blind
I need to run towards the light
No tears falling down my eyes
No fear left into my mind
All this evil turned me blind
I need to run towards the light"
Come Out And Play,Billie Eilish,"Wake up and smell the coffee
Is your cup half full or empty?
When we talk, you say it softly
But I love it when you're awfully quiet, quiet

You see a piece of paper
Could be a little greater
Show me what you could make her
You'll never know until you try it
You don't have to keep it quiet

And I know it makes you nervous
But I promise you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything you kept inside
Don't hide, don't hide
Too shy to say, but I hope you stay
Don't hide away
Come out and play

Look up, out of your window
See snow, won't let it in though
Leave home, feel the wind blow
'Cause it's colder here inside in silence
You don't have to keep it quiet

Yeah, I know it makes you nervous
But I promise you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything you kept inside
Don't hide, don't hide
Too shy to say but I hope you stay
Don't hide away
Come out and play"
Ghost,Au/Ra & Alan Walker,"Today I'm kinda feelin' like a ghost
Call my friends but ain't nobody home
Tell myself I'm fine, but I don't really know
I'm just scared that I'll end up
I'll end up, I'll end up alone

I never let it show
But I feel like a missed call on a phone
Tryna live my life pay as you go
But I'm so scared that I'll end up
I'll end up, I'll end up alone

You know I'm like a ghost
Sometimes I have to fade
And it haunts me that I have to be this way
You say it's gone cold
I say I'll do better
But I always seem to disappear again
You know I'm like a ghost
I see it in your face
And it haunts me that I have to be this way
You say it's gone cold
I say I'll do better
But I always seem to disappear again
You know I'm like a ghost...

You know I never meant to cut you off
Got phantom feelings I can never stop
Stranger things to worry 'bout I know
But I'm so scared that I'll end up
I'll end up, I'll end up alone

I can't see myself in the mirror
Does that mean I'm not really here?
I'm losin' touch with everything I know
And I'm so scared that I'll end up
I'll end up, I'll end up alone

You know I'm like a ghost
Sometimes I have to fade
And it haunts me that I have to be this way
You say it's gone cold
I say I'll do better
But I always seem to disappear again
You know I'm like a ghost
I see it in your face
And it haunts me that I have to be this way
You say it's gone cold
I say I'll do better
But I always seem to disappear again
You know I'm like a ghost

You know I'm like a ghost...
Ooh, I'll be OK
I'll be alright
I know, Ooh, I'll be OK

I'm just scared that I'll end up alone

You know I'm like a ghost
I see it in your face
And it haunts me that I have to be this way
You say it's gone cold
I say I'll do better
But I always seem to disappear again
You know I'm like a ghost"
Lily,"Alan Walker, K-391 & Emelie Hollow","Lily was a little girl
Afraid of the big, wide world
She grew up within her castle walls
Now and then she tried to run
And then on the night with the setting sun
She went in the woods away
So afraid, all alone

They warned her, don't go there
There's creatures who are hiding in the dark
Then something came creeping
It told her, don't you worry just

Follow everywhere I go
Top of all the mountains or valley low
Give you everything you've been dreaming of
Just let me in, ooh
Everything you want in gold
I'll be the magic story you've been told
And you'll be safe under my control
Just let me in, ooh
Just let me in, ooh

She knew she was hypnotized
And walking on cold thin ice
Then it broke, and she awoke again

Then she ran faster and
Start screaming, is there someone out there?
Please help me, come get me
Behind her, she can hear it say

Follow everywhere I go
Top of all the mountains or valley low
Give you everything you've been dreaming of
Just let me in, ooh
Everything you want in gold
I'll be the magic story you've been told
And you'll be safe under my control
Just let me in, ooh
Just let me in, ooh

Everything you want in gold
I'll be the magic story you've been told
And you'll be safe under my control
Just let me in, ooh

Follow everywhere I go
Top of all the mountains or valley low
Give you everything you've been dreaming of
Just let me in, ooh

Start screaming, is there someone out there?

Niggas up, she in the back of the truck
Lil' mommy wanna fuck and she really wanna suck
When I finish with it then we go in the back of the club
And we do this shit again my nigga, pronto
Bip-de-badda-de-booda-de-beat it like a bongo
Banging on the pussy like a nigga named Alonzo
Head game crazy, that make her the head honcho
Mad cause I took his bitch and now he thinks he macho?
Somebody better call the cops yo

Put him in a box so the nigga in a cargo (cargo, cargo)
Shut a nigga down (fake bitch)

10031 is where my zip is
Livin how I live up in the trenches
Run through a bodega like I ain't got riches
Run through a bodega like I ain't got (come on)
Don't do it for the haters, I do it for the bitches
My flow Al-Qaeda, I kill rap niggas
Y'all Now and Laters, sweet ass-niggas
Soon as you get famous, they wanna ass-kiss
Only thing that I'm missing is Hov verse (JAY-Z)
I get a feeling, they want the old Ferg
""Cocaine Castle"", ""Hood Pope"" Ferg
Got a question to ask, do you know Ferg?
Do you know that I come from where the toast burn?
New York, New York, I run for dirt
On Hungry Ham up on the corner
Fiends taste the lean, they never sober
For being in the streets to run a culture
I never been in the weave, I had hoes, brah
Who's that jiggy motherfucker with the clothes, brah?
I'm finna kill these motherfuckers with the flow, brah
I'm the best in the game with the flow, brah
In New York I Milly Rock to Magnolia

South to North and even West Coast, brah

[A$AP Rocky:]
Blackin' like I'm fresh out from retirement
My flow still monumental
Mental, couldn't ride an instrumental but they ridin' dick
I set the standard for requirements, so call the firemen
Just me, myself and I, the world is mine, I put the ""I"" in his
His posse too clean, his diamonds like tip
His skin too clear, his bitch gon' stare
So mind your biz, how they find the time for minding mine
I find these college chicks for top with Kylie's lips
Oh my, oh my (running)
Running, running like you want it (running)
Running, running like you stole it (running)
Running, running like I'm going (woo)
Running, pitching like I'm bowling (woo)
In my city, gangs run the inner city
Load a semi for the chiddy bang
Flacko, Fergie, Frenchie with the bitties
Hit up Remy for the pretty gang

[Dave East:]
Lately I feel like a Beatle
I'm Paulie McCartney just rocking Moschino
Moscato or Pinot
I got some bitches to hop in the Regal, phenomenal deep throat
I'm more Ali than Muhammad
My noodles was Ramen, go Google my diamonds
I got some shooters in college
I feel like a coach, I'm recruiting and signing
Look, I still be moving in silence
I'm ballin' in blue like I'm hooping in Dallas
Bitch I don't play for no Mavericks
You need to think who gon' pay for your casket
Ignorant bastard
But I'm still conscious enough to give hope to the masses
Watch the coke do gymnastics
Dominique Dawes, foreign my car when I'm mashin'

[French Montana:]
Chain busting it down, wrist busting it down
Your bitch busting it down, rap game up fucking it now
I could be a jeweler, neck on Slick the Ruler
You niggas is comedy, talking fast like Bone Thugs-N-Harmony
KRS-One, Big L flows
Son of a gun with the Buffalo
Head on my wrist is a P1
Made more money than E1
One time Chinx, two time Yams (Yams)
Get the money slide like a violin
You know my nigga Max almost home
You know we run the East Coast zone nigga

[Rick Ross:]
In the kitchen culinary, I could whip a Bloody Mary
And I wish that blood would dead me, I'ma get your brother burried
Gangbanging with your halo, business on the payphone
Bitches pussies drying up, like Taz's Angels
Never was a client, 'cause that boy ain't buying it
And I got a bottom bitch, my top come on consignment
Step up from the minor league, double M the dynasty
No I never sold dope, I just got me a finder's fee
Following my frequency, niggas rapping week to week
Suckers be so weak to me, text but don't speak to me
You can never speak for me, see the B.I. chemistry
Check into the crazy house, I'ma turn the labels out

Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up
Run it up, run it up, run it up, run it up (remix)

10-20 was my date of birth, the day I came to Earth
Bottles sipping, love to burp, young nigga that's doing dirt
Long Beach across my shirt, all y'all niggas gon' get merked
What the fuck is you talking 'bout?
Me and Ferg, we gon' put in work
Bang on ya' gang culture, out of this world
It's all on a bitch, is she a Blood? Is she a Crip?
Don't slip, think not, on the block where it's hot
Legalize with the nines, give a fuck about a cop
Real shit, this is it, from the bottom to the Bay
This is anybody K, California all day
Yes-sir, on the curb, Mossberg by the band
Little homies on the roof with the blam, blam, blam!
Long Beach, popping pill on 'em
I been working so hard, nigga, get your bale on
I been working so hard, nigga, work to sell somethin'
I been working so hard, welcome to the hellzone, zone, zone
See I'm from Long Beach

With You (Paradoxology),Elevation Worship,"Beneath the surface

Beckons a calmness

Every doubt, every imperfection

I just wanna be here with You
I'm lost in Your mystery
I'm found in Your love for me
I just wanna be here with You

Here in the waiting
I won't worry about tomorrow
No need to focus
On the things I can't control

All my attention
On the wonder of this moment
Jesus, your presence

There's nowhere I'd rather be
When You're singing over me
I just wanna be here with You
I'm lost in Your mystery
I'm found in Your love for me
I just wanna be here with You

Be consumed with who You are
All the glory of Your presence
What more could I ask for?

Nobody else above you
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to ask you
If you're okay
My friends always
Feel the need to tell me things
Seems like they're just happier
Than us these days
Yeah, these days I don't know
How to talk to you
I don't know to be there
When you need me
It feels like the only time you'll see me
Is when you turn your head
To the side and look at me differently
Ohh...
Yeah, and last night
I think I lost my patience
Last night I got high as your expectations
Last night, oh I came to realization
And I hope you could take it
I hope you could take it all

I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it

I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it

Ohh...
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I will never be her"
As You Find Me,Hillsong United,"I've been strong and I've been broken within a moment
I've been faithful and I've been reckless at every bend
I've held everything together and watched it shatter
I've stood tall and I have crumbled in the same breath

I have wrestled and I have trembled toward surrender
Chased my heart adrift and drifted home again
Plundered blessing till I've been desperate to find redemption
And every time I turn around Lord You're still there

I was found before I was lost
I was Yours before I was not
Grace to spare for all my mistakes
And that part just wrecks me

And I know I
I don't deserve this kind of love
Somehow
This kind of love is who You are
It's a grace I could never add up
To be somebody You still want
Somehow
You love me as You find me

Who am I to think Your glory needs my praises
But if this borrowed breath is Yours Lord take it all
You are faithful and You are gracious and I'm just grateful
To think you don't need a single thing and still You want my heart

I was found before I was lost
I was Yours before I was not
You wear the scars
And that part just wrecks me

And I know I
I don't deserve this kind of love
Somehow
This kind of love is who You are
It's a grace I could never add up
To be somebody You still want
Somehow
You love me as You find me
You love me as You find me
You love me as You find me
You love me as You find me

Your love's too good to leave me here (You love me as You find me)
Your love's too good to leave me here (You love me as You find me)
Your love's too good to leave me here (You love me as You find me)
Your love's too good to leave me here (You love me as You find me)
Your love's too good to leave me here
If you want my heart I won't second guess
Cause I need Your love more than anything
I'm in
I'm Yours
Your love's too good to leave me here
Your love's too good to leave me here
Your love's too good

And I know I
I don't deserve this kind of love
Somehow
This kind of love is who You are
It's a grace I could never add up
To be somebody You still want
Somehow
You love me as You find me
You love me as You find me
You love me as You find me"
Hosanna,Hillsong United,"I see the King of glory
Coming on the clouds with fire
The whole earth shakes
The whole earth shakes

Yeah

I see His love and mercy
Washing over all our sin
The people sing
The people sing

[Chorus]
Hosanna
Hosanna
Hosanna in the highest [x2]

I see a generation
Rising up to take their place
With selfless faith
With selfless faith

I see a near revival
Stirring as we pray and seek
We're on our knees
We're on our knees

[Chorus]

Heal my heart and make it clean
Open up my eyes to the things unseen
Show me how to love like You have loved me

Break my heart for what breaks Yours
Everything I am for Your kingdom's cause
As I walk from earth into eternity

[Chorus x2]

Hosanna in the highest"
