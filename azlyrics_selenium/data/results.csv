Wouldn't Mean A Thing,Bruno Major,"I could climb the Himalayan mountains
Or the pyramids in West Peru
I could travel back in time and hear Al Green sing
It wouldn't mean a thing without you
I could sail across the Indian Ocean
And bathe in the reflection of the moon
I could find the buried treasure of ancient kings
But it wouldn't mean a thing without you
No, it wouldn't mean a thing without you

You bring out the best in me
Help me see the world differently
Be a better man than I'd ever be on my own
I'll give you the rest of me
You're the reason I rest easily
It's the love and loyalty you've shown

I could work hard, make a fortune
Bet it all on red only to lose
If money comes my way I won't be complaining
It wouldn't mean a thing without you
No, it wouldn't mean a thing without you

You bring out the best in me
Help me see the world differently
Be a better man than I'd ever be on my own
I'll give you the rest of me
You're the reason I rest easily
It's the love and loyalty you've shown

I could climb the Himalayan mountains
Or the pyramids in West Peru
I could travel back in time and hear Al Green sing
It wouldn't mean a thing with out you
No, it wouldn't mean a thing without you"
Death Of A Bachelor,NateWantsToBattle,"Do I look lonely?
I see the shadows on my face
People have told me
I don't look the same
Maybe I lost weight
I'm playing hooky
With the best of the best
Pull my heart out my chest
So that you can see it too

I'm walking the long road
Watching the sky fall
The lace in your dress
Tangles my neck
How do I live?

The death of a bachelor
Oh oh-oh
Letting the water fall
The death of a bachelor
Oh oh-oh
Seems so fitting for
Happily ever after
Whooo
How could I ask for more?
Lifetime of laughter
At the expense of the death of a bachelor

I'm cutting my mind off
Feels like my heart is going to burst
Alone at a table for two
And I just want to be served
And when you think of me
Am I the best you've ever had?
Share one more drink with me
Smile even though you're sad

I'm walking the long road
Watching the sky fall
The lace in your dress
Tangles my neck
How do I live?

The death of a bachelor
Oh oh-oh
Letting the water fall
The death of a bachelor
Oh oh-oh
Seems so fitting for
Happily ever after
Whooo
How could I ask for more?
Lifetime of laughter
At the expense of the death of a bachelor

The death of a bachelor
Oh oh-oh
Letting the water fall
The death of a bachelor
Oh oh-oh
Seems so fitting for
Happily ever after
Whooo
How could I ask for more?
Lifetime of laughter
At the expense of the death of a bachelor"
Who Says,John Mayer,"Who says I can’t get stoned?
Turn off the lights and the telephone
Me in my house alone
Who says I can’t get stoned?

Who says I can’t be free?
From all of the things that I used to be
Re-write my history
Who says I can’t be free?

It’s been a long night in New York City
It’s been a long night in Baton Rouge
I don’t remember you looking any better
But then again I don’t remember you

Who says I can’t get stoned?
Call up a girl that I used to know
Fake love for an hour or so
Who says I can’t get stoned?

Who says I can’t take time?
Meet all the girls on the county line
Wait on fate to send a sign
Who says I can’t take time?

It’s been a long night in New York City
It’s been a long night in Austin too
I don’t remember you looking any better
But then again I don’t remember you

Who says I can’t get stoned?
Plan a trip to Japan alone
Doesn’t matter if I even go
Who says I can’t get stoned?
Mmhmm

It’s been a long night in New York City
It’s been a long time since 22
I don’t remember you looking any better
But then again I don’t remember, don't remember you"
Another In The Fire,Hillsong United,"There's a grace when the heart is under fire
Another way when the walls are closing in
And when I look at the space between
Where I used to be and this reckoning
I know I will never be alone

There was another in the fire
Standing next to me
There was another in the waters
Holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding
Of how I've been set free
There is a cross that bears the burden
Where another died for me

There is another in the fire

All my debt left for dead beneath the waters
I'm no longer a slave to my sin anymore
And should I fall in the space between
What remains of me and this reckoning
Either way I won't bow to the things of this world

'Cause I know

And I know I will never be alone

There is another in the fire
Standing next to me
There is another in the waters
Holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding
What power set me free
There is a grave that holds no body
And now that power lives in me

There is another in the fire
There is another in the fire
There is another in the fire
There is another in the fire

I can see

And I can see the light in the darkness
As the darkness bows to Him
I can hear the roar in the heavens
As the space between wears thin

I can feel the ground shake beneath us
As the prison walls cave in
Nothing stands between us
Nothing stands between us

And there is no other name
But the name that is Jesus
He who was and still is
And will be through it all
So come what may in the space between
All the things unseen
And this reckoning
I know I will never be alone

I know. Come on
I know I will never be alone

There'll be another in the fire
Standing next to me
There'll be another in the waters
Holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding
How good You've been to me
I'll count the joy come every battle
'Cause I know that's where You'll be

I can see the light

And I can see the light in the darkness
As the darkness bows to Him
I can hear the roar in the heavens
As the space between wears thin

I can feel the ground shake beneath us
As the prison walls cave in
Nothing stands between us
Nothing stands between

There'll be another in the fire
Standing next to me
There'll be another in the waters
Holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding
How good You've been to me
I'll count the joy come every battle
'Cause I know that's where You'll be

Count the joy come every battle
'Cause I know that's where You'll be
Count the joy come every battle
'Cause I know that's where You'll be

Sing it again

I'll count the joy come every battle
'Cause I know that's where You'll be
I'll count the joy come every battle
'Cause I know that's where You'll be"
Hosanna,Hillsong United,"I see the King of glory
Coming on the clouds with fire
The whole earth shakes
The whole earth shakes

Yeah

I see His love and mercy
Washing over all our sin
The people sing
The people sing

[Chorus]
Hosanna
Hosanna
Hosanna in the highest [x2]

I see a generation
Rising up to take their place
With selfless faith
With selfless faith

I see a near revival
Stirring as we pray and seek
We're on our knees
We're on our knees

[Chorus]

Heal my heart and make it clean
Open up my eyes to the things unseen
Show me how to love like You have loved me

Break my heart for what breaks Yours
Everything I am for Your kingdom's cause
As I walk from earth into eternity

[Chorus x2]

Hosanna in the highest"
As You Find Me,Hillsong United,"I've been strong and I've been broken within a moment
I've been faithful and I've been reckless at every bend
I've held everything together and watched it shatter
I've stood tall and I have crumbled in the same breath

I have wrestled and I have trembled toward surrender
Chased my heart adrift and drifted home again
Plundered blessing till I've been desperate to find redemption
And every time I turn around Lord You're still there

I was found before I was lost
I was Yours before I was not
Grace to spare for all my mistakes
And that part just wrecks me

And I know I
I don't deserve this kind of love
Somehow
This kind of love is who You are
It's a grace I could never add up
To be somebody You still want
Somehow
You love me as You find me

Who am I to think Your glory needs my praises
But if this borrowed breath is Yours Lord take it all
You are faithful and You are gracious and I'm just grateful
To think you don't need a single thing and still You want my heart

I was found before I was lost
I was Yours before I was not
You wear the scars
And that part just wrecks me

And I know I
I don't deserve this kind of love
Somehow
This kind of love is who You are
It's a grace I could never add up
To be somebody You still want
Somehow
You love me as You find me
You love me as You find me
You love me as You find me
You love me as You find me

Your love's too good to leave me here (You love me as You find me)
Your love's too good to leave me here (You love me as You find me)
Your love's too good to leave me here (You love me as You find me)
Your love's too good to leave me here (You love me as You find me)
Your love's too good to leave me here
If you want my heart I won't second guess
Cause I need Your love more than anything
I'm in
I'm Yours
Your love's too good to leave me here
Your love's too good to leave me here
Your love's too good

And I know I
I don't deserve this kind of love
Somehow
This kind of love is who You are
It's a grace I could never add up
To be somebody You still want
Somehow
You love me as You find me
You love me as You find me
You love me as You find me"
Malibu Nights,LANY,"There's no reason, there's no rhyme
I found myself blindsided by
A feeling that I've never known
I'm dealing with it on my own

Phone is quiet, walls are bare
I drink myself to sleep. Who cares?
No one even has to know
I'm dealing with it on my own

I've got way too much time to be this hurt
Somebody, help. It's getting worse
What do you do with a broken heart?
Once the light fades, everything is dark

Way too much whiskey in my blood
I feel my body giving up
Can I hold on for another night?
What do I do with all this time?

Heavy thoughts, when it gets late
Put me in a fragile state
I wish I wasn't going home
Dealing with it on my own

I'm praying, but it's not enough
I'm done. I don't believe in love
Learning how to let it go
Dealing with it on my own

I've got way too much time to be this hurt
Somebody, help. It's getting worse
What do you do with a broken heart?
Once the light fades, everything is dark

Way too much whiskey in my blood
I feel my body giving up
Can I hold on for another night?
What do I do with all this time?
Yeah

I drive circles under street lights
Nothing seems to clear my mind
I can't forget
If it's inside my head
So, I drive chasing Malibu nights
Nothing seems to heal my mind
I can't forget

I've got way too much time to be this hurt
Somebody, help. It's getting worse
What do you do with a broken heart?
Once the light fades, everything is dark

Way too much whiskey in my blood
I feel my body giving up
Can I hold on for another night?
What do I do with all this time?
Yeah

I drive circles under street lights
Nothing seems to clear my mind
I can't forget
If it's inside my head
So, I drive chasing Malibu nights
Nothing seems to heal my mind
I can't forget
If it's inside my head

So, I drive chasing Malibu nights
Nothing seems to heal my mind"
The 1975,The 1975,"We are right now in the beginning of a climate and ecological crisis, and we need to call it what it is: an emergency. We must acknowledge that we do not have the situation under control, and that we don't have all the solutions yet; unless those solutions mean that we simply stop doing certain things. We must admit that we are losing this battle. We have to acknowledge that the older generations have failed. All political movements in their present form have failed, but Homo sapiens have not yet failed. Yes, we are failing, but there is still time to turn everything around. We can still fix this. We still have everything in our own hands, but unless we recognise the overall failures of our current systems, we most probably don't stand a chance.

We are facing a disaster of unspoken sufferings for enormous amounts of people, and now is not the time for speaking politely or focusing on what we can or cannot say. Now is the time to speak clearly. Solving the climate crisis is the greatest and most complex challenge that Homo sapiens have ever faced. The main solution, however, is so simple that even a small child can understand it: we have to stop our emissions of greenhouse gases, and either we do that, or we don't. You say that nothing in life is black or white, but that is a lie, a very dangerous lie. Either we prevent a 1.5 degree of warming, or we don't; either we avoid setting off that irreversible chain reaction beyond human control, or we don't; either we choose to go on as a civilization, or we don't. That is as black or white as it gets because there are no grey areas when it comes to survival.

Now we all have a choice: we can create transformational action that will safeguard the living conditions for future generations, or we can continue with our business as usual and fail. That is up to you and me. And yes, we need a system change rather than individual change, but you cannot have one without the other. If you look through history, all the big changes in society have been started by people at the grassroots level—people like you and me. So, I ask you to please wake up and make the changes required possible. To do your best is no longer good enough. We must all do the seemingly impossible. Today, we use about 100 million barrels of oil every single day. There are no politics to change that; there are no rules to keep that oil in the ground. So, we can no longer save the world by playing by the rules, because the rules have to be changed. Everything needs to change, and it has to start today. So, everyone out there, it is now time for civil disobedience. It is time to rebel."
Highlands (Song Of Ascent),Hillsong United,"O how high would I climb mountains
If the mountains were where You hide
O how far I'd scale the valleys
If You graced the other side

O how long have I chased rivers
From lowly seas to where they rise
Against the rush of grace descending
From the source of its supply

Cause in the highlands and the heartache
You're neither more or less inclined
I would search and stop at nothing
You're just not that hard to find

Oh I will praise You on the mountain
And I will praise you when the mountain's in my way
You're the summit where my feet are
So I will praise You in the valleys all the same
No less God within the shadows
No less faithful when the night leads me astray
Cause You're the Heaven where my heart is
In the highlands and the heartache all the same

O how far beneath Your glory
Does Your kindness extend the path
From where your feet rest on the sunrise
To where You sweep the sinner's past

And though how fast would you come running
If just to shadow me through the night
Trace my steps through all my failures
And walk me out the other side

For who could dare ascend that mountain
That valleyed hill called Calvary
But for the One I call Good Shepherd
Who like a lamb was slain for me

Oh I will praise You on the mountain
And I will praise you when the mountain's in my way
You're the summit where my feet are
So I will praise You in the valleys all the same
No less God within the shadows
No less faithful when the night leads me astray
Cause You're the Heaven where my heart is
In the highlands and the heartache all the same

Sing it out

Whatever I walk through
Wherever I am
Your Name can move mountains
Wherever I stand
And if ever I walk through
The valley of death
I'll sing through the shadows
My song of ascent

Whatever I walk through
Wherever I am
Your Name can move mountains
Wherever I stand
And if ever I walk through
The valley of death
I'll sing through the shadows
My song of ascent
My song of ascent

Sing it out

My song of ascent

From the gravest of all valleys
Come the pastures we call grace
A mighty river flowing upwards
From a deep but empty grave

So I will praise You on the mountain
And I will praise you when the mountain's in my way
You're the summit where my feet are
Yes you are
So I will praise You in the valleys all the same
No less God within the shadows
No less faithful when the night leads me astray
You're the Heaven where my heart is
In the highlands and the heartache all the same"

결말을 미리 본 영화처럼
부담스러웠지 넌 점점 더
빈 틈 없이 짜여진 스토리처럼

헤어지자 그 한마디가 잔인한 거겠지
입을 열어도 다시 삼키고 왜 못 뱉는거지

널 사랑은 하지만 조금 지친거야
상처를 주기가 너무 두려운거야
착한 게 아냐 날 위해 그런거야
아직도 널 사랑한다는 거짓말

하루에 몇 번씩 생각했지
나 없이 넌 어떻게 지낼지
지키지 못할 많은 약속들
이젠 의미 없는 말들로 남겠지

헤어지자 그 한마디가 잔인한 거겠지
입을 열어도 다시 삼키고 왜 못 뱉는거지

널 사랑은 하지만 조금 지친거야

I do love you but I'm a bit tired
I'm too scared to hurt you
I'm not being nice, I'm doing this for myself
This lie of saying I still love you

You wanted an answer from the start
Like already wanting to know the ending of a movie
So I felt pressured, more and more
Like a perfectly made-up story

Let's break up, those words are so cruel
I open my mouth but I swallow it back in, why can't I say it?

I do love you but I'm a bit tired
I'm too scared to hurt you
I'm not being nice, I'm doing this for myself
This lie of saying I still love you

I thought about this several times a day
How you would live without me
All the promises that won't be kept
They'll just remain as meaningless words

Let's break up, those words are so cruel
I open my mouth but I swallow it back in, why can't I say it?

I do love you but I'm a bit tired
I'm too scared to hurt you
I'm not being nice, I'm doing this for myself

Whole Heart (Hold Me Now),Hillsong United,"Hold me now
In the hands that created the heavens
Find me now
Where the grace runs as deep as Your scars
You pulled me from the clay
You set me on a rock
Called me by Your Name
And made my heart whole again

Lifted up
And my knees know it's all for Your glory
I might stand
With more reasons to sing than to fear
You pulled me from the clay
Set me on a rock
Called me by Your Name
And made my heart whole again

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

Once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds me now

And that grace
Owns the ground where the grave did
Where all my shame remains
Left for dead in Your wake
You crashed those age-old gates
You left no stone unturned
You stepped out of that grave
And shouldered me all the way

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

Once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds me now

Healed and forgiven
Look where my chains are now
Death has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds that ground
And Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now

So here I stand

So Will I (100 Billion X),Hillsong Worship,"God of creation
There at the start
Before the beginning of time
With no point of reference
You spoke to the dark
And fleshed out the wonder of light

And as You speak
A hundred billion galaxies are born
In the vapour of Your breath the planets form
If the stars were made to worship so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You've made
Every burning star
A signal fire of grace
If creation sings Your praises so will I

God of Your promise
You don't speak in vain
No syllable empty or void
For once You have spoken
All nature and science
Follow the sound of Your voice

And as You speak
A hundred billion creatures catch Your breath
Evolving in pursuit of what You said
If it all reveals Your nature so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You say
Every painted sky
A canvas of Your grace
If creation still obeys You so will I

If the stars were made to worship so will I
If the mountains bow in reverence so will I
If the oceans roar Your greatness so will I
For if everything exists to lift You high so will I
If the wind goes where You send it so will I
If the rocks cry out in silence so will I
If the sum of all our praises still falls shy
Then we'll sing again a hundred billion times

God of salvation
You chased down my heart
Through all of my failure and pride
On a hill You created
The light of the world
Abandoned in darkness to die

And as You speak
A hundred billion failures disappear
Where You lost Your life so I could find it here
If You left the grave behind You so will I
I can see Your heart in everything You've done
Every part designed in a work of art called love
If You gladly chose surrender so will I
I can see Your heart
Eight billion different ways
Every precious one
A child You died to save
If You gave Your life to love them so will I

Like You would again a hundred billion times
But what measure could amount to Your desire
You're the One who never leaves the one behind"

Did you hear the oceans roar?
When the people rose to sing of
Jesus Christ, the Risen One

Did you feel the people tremble?
Did you hear the singers roar?
When the lost began to sing of
Jesus Christ, the Saving One

(We can sing that)
We can see that, God, You're moving
A mighty river through the nations
When young and old will turn to Jesus
Fling wide you heavenly gates
Prepare the way of the risen Lord

And open up the doors
And let the music play
Let the streets resound with singing
Songs that bring Your hope
Songs that bring Your joy, joy
Dancers who dance upon injustice

And do you feel the darkness tremble?
When all the saints join in one song
When all the streams flow as one river
To wash away our brokenness
(Oh, sing it out again)
Do you feel the darkness tremble?
When all the saints join in one song
And all the streams flow as one river
To wash away our brokenness

(And hear we see)
Hear we see that, God, You're moving
A time of jubilee is coming
When young and old return to Jesus
Fling wide you heavenly gates
Prepare the way of the risen Lord

Another In The Fire,Hillsong United,"There's a grace when the heart is under fire
Another way when the walls are closing in
And when I look at the space between
Where I used to be and this reckoning
I know I will never be alone

There was another in the fire
Standing next to me
There was another in the waters
Holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding
Of how I've been set free
There is a cross that bears the burden
Where another died for me

There is another in the fire

All my debt left for dead beneath the waters
I'm no longer a slave to my sin anymore
And should I fall in the space between
What remains of me and this reckoning
Either way I won't bow to the things of this world

'Cause I know

And I know I will never be alone

There is another in the fire
Standing next to me
There is another in the waters
Holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding
What power set me free
There is a grave that holds no body
And now that power lives in me

There is another in the fire
There is another in the fire
There is another in the fire
There is another in the fire

I can see

And I can see the light in the darkness
As the darkness bows to Him
I can hear the roar in the heavens
As the space between wears thin

I can feel the ground shake beneath us
As the prison walls cave in
Nothing stands between us
Nothing stands between us

And there is no other name
But the name that is Jesus
He who was and still is
And will be through it all
So come what may in the space between
All the things unseen
And this reckoning
I know I will never be alone

I know. Come on
I know I will never be alone

There'll be another in the fire
Standing next to me
There'll be another in the waters
Holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding
How good You've been to me
I'll count the joy come every battle
'Cause I know that's where You'll be

I can see the light

And I can see the light in the darkness
As the darkness bows to Him
I can hear the roar in the heavens
As the space between wears thin

I can feel the ground shake beneath us
As the prison walls cave in
Nothing stands between us
Nothing stands between

There'll be another in the fire
Standing next to me
There'll be another in the waters
Holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding
How good You've been to me
I'll count the joy come every battle
'Cause I know that's where You'll be

Count the joy come every battle
'Cause I know that's where You'll be
Count the joy come every battle
'Cause I know that's where You'll be

Sing it again

I'll count the joy come every battle
'Cause I know that's where You'll be
I'll count the joy come every battle
'Cause I know that's where You'll be"
Best Part,Joseph Vincent,"You don't know babe
When you hold me
And kiss me slowly
It's the sweetest thing
And it don't change
If I had it my way
You would know that you are

You're the coffee that I need in the morning
You're my sunshine in the rain when it's pouring
Won't you give yourself to me
Give it all

I just wanna see, yeah
I just wanna see how beautiful you are
You know that I see it
I know you're a star
Where you go I follow
No matter how far
If life is a movie
Oh you're the best part, ohh
You're the best part, ohh
Best part

It's the sunrise
And those brown eyes
You're the one that I desire
When we wake up
And then we make love
It makes me feel so nice

You're my water when I'm stuck in the desert
You're my Tylenol I take when my head hurts
You're the sunshine on my life

I just wanna see how beautiful you are
You know that I see it
I know you're a star
Where you go I follow
No matter how far
If life is a movie
Ohh, you're the best part
Ohh, you're the best part
Ohh, best part"

Mortal Man,Kendrick Lamar,"The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let these words be your earth and moon
You consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said my nigga, let me ask this question:

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan (one two, one two)
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let these words be your earth and moon
You consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said my nigga, let me ask this question:

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

Do you believe in me? Are you deceiving me?
Could I let you down easily, is your heart where it need to be?
Is your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime?
Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line?
If I'm tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off
If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car
Would you judge me a drug-head or see me as K. Lamar
Or question my character and degrade me on every blog
Want you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson
I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you're very welcome
You tell me my song is more than a song, it's surely a blessing
But a prophet ain't a prophet til they ask you this question:

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let my words be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And with that

Do you believe in me? How much you believe in her?
You think she gon' stick around if them 25 years occur?
You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars hurt?
You think y'all on common ground if you promise to be the first? Can you be immortalised without your life being expired?
Even though you share the same blood is it worth the time?
Like who got your best interest?
Like how much are you dependent?
How clutch are the people that say they love you?
And who pretending?
How tough is your skin when they turn you in?
Do you show forgiveness?
What brush do you bend when dusting your shoulders from being offended?
What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing?
What kind of bridge did they burn?
Revenge or your mind when it's mentioned?
You wanna love like Nelson, you wanna be like Nelson
You wanna walk in his shoes but you peacemaking seldom
You wanna be remembered that delivered the message
That considered the blessing of everyone
This your lesson for everyone, say

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

The voice of Mandela, hope this flow stay propellin'
Let my word be your Earth and moon
You consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me, nigga

I been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues
I hold grudges like bad judges, don't let me resent you
That's not Nelson-like, want you to love me like Nelson
I went to Robben's Island analysing, that's where his cell is
So I could find clarity, like how much you cherish me
Is this relationship a fake or real as the heavens be?
See I got to question it all, family, friends, fans, cats, dogs
Trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow
Murphy's Law, generation X, will I ever be your X?
Floss off a baby step, mauled by the mouth of
Pit bulls, put me under stress
Crawled under rocks, ducking y'all, it's respect
But then tomorrow, put my back against the wall
How many leaders you said you needed then left 'em for dead?
Is it Moses, is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red?
Is it Martin Luther, JFK, shoot or you assassin
Is it Jackie, is it Jesse, oh I know, it's Michael Jackson, oh

When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
That nigga gave us ""Billie Jean"", you say he touched those kids?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?

The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let my word be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me nigga, let me ask this question nigga

[Kendrick Lamar:]
""I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn't stop survivor's guilt
Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting the continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned
The word was respect
Just because you wore a different gang color than mine's
Doesn't mean I can't respect you as a black man
Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
But I don't know, I'm no mortal man, maybe I'm just another nigga""

Shit and that's all I wrote
I was gonna call it
Another Nigga but, it ain't really a poem, I just felt like it's
something you probably could relate to. Other than that, now that I
finally got a chance to holla at you, I always wanted to ask you about a
certain situa--, about a metaphor actually, you spoke on the ground.
What you mean 'bout that, what the ground represent?

[2Pac:]
The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Right

[2Pac:]
That's how I see it, my word is bond. I see - and
the ground is the symbol for the poor people, the poor people is gonna
open up this whole world and swallow up the rich people. Cause the rich
people gonna be so fat, they gonna be so appetising, you know what I'm
saying, wealthy, appetising. The poor gonna be so poor and hungry, you
know what I'm saying it's gonna be like… there might be some cannibalism
out this mutha, they might eat the rich

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Aight
so let me ask you this then, do you see yourself as somebody that's
rich or somebody that made the best of their own opportunities?

[2Pac:]
I
see myself as a natural born hustler, a true hustler in every sense of
the word. I took nothin', I took the opportunities, I worked at the most
menial and degrading job and built myself up so I could get it to where
I owned it. I went from having somebody manage me to me hiring the
person that works my management company. I changed everything I realized
my destiny in a matter of five years you know what I'm saying I made
myself a millionaire. I made millions for a lot of people now it's time
to make millions for myself, you know what I'm saying. I made millions
for the record companies, I made millions for these movie companies, now
I make millions for us

[Kendrick Lamar:]
And through your different avenues of success, how would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?

[2Pac:]
By
my faith in God, by my faith in the game, and by my faith in ""all good
things come to those that stay true."" You know what I'm saying, and it
was happening to me for a reason, you know what I'm saying, I was
noticing, shit, I was
punching the right buttons and it was happening. So it's no problem, you
know I mean it's a problem but I'm not finna let them know. I'm finna
go straight through

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?

[2Pac:]
Shit,
I like to think that at every opportunity I've ever been threatened
with resistance, it's been met with resistance. And not only me but it
goes down my family tree. You know what I'm saying, it's in my veins to
fight back

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Aight well, how long you think it
take before niggas be like, we fighting a war, I'm fighting a war I
can't win and I wanna lay it all down

[2Pac:]
In this country a
black man only have like 5 years we can exhibit maximum strength, and
that's right now while you a teenager, while you still strong or while
you still wanna lift weights, while you still wanna shoot back. Cause
once you turn 30 it's like they take the heart and soul out of a man,
out of a black man in this country. And you don't wanna fight no more.
And if you don't believe me you can look around, you don't see no loud
mouth 30-year old muthafuckas

[Kendrick Lamar:]
That's crazy,
because me being one of your offspring of the legacy you left behind I
can truly tell you that there's nothing but turmoil goin' on so I wanted
to ask you what you think is the future for me and my generation today?

[2Pac:]
I think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores and next time it's a riot there's gonna be, like, uh, bloodshed for real. I don't think America
know that. I think American think we was just playing and it's gonna be
some more playing but it ain't gonna be no playing. It's gonna be
murder, you know what I'm saying, it's gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831,
up in this muthafucka. You know what I'm saying, it's gonna happen

[Kendrick Lamar:]
That's
crazy man. In my opinion, only hope that we kinda have left is music
and vibrations, lotta people don't understand how important it is.
Sometimes I be like, get behind a mic and I don't know what type of
energy I'mma push out, or where it comes from. Trip me out sometimes

[2Pac:]
Because the spirits, we ain't even really rappin', we just letting our dead homies tell stories for us

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Damn

I wanted to read one last thing to you. It's actually something a good friend had wrote describing my world. It says:

""The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it, in order to protect itself from this mad city
While consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him, but praises the butterfly
The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness, and the beauty within the caterpillar
But
having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the butterfly as
weak and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits
Already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him
He can no longer see past his own thoughts
He's trapped
When trapped inside these walls certain ideas take roots, such as going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city
The result?
Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant
Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle
Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different, they are one and the same.""

What's your perspective on that?
Pac? Pac?
Pac?!"
Nonchalant,6LACK,"Watch your mouth when you lettin' shit slide

To care a little more about my peers
To think a little less about my fears
To care a little more about your ears

Every day that I'm alive, I’ma ride with the stick
I'd rather be broke in jail than be dead and rich
Told my brothers take my breath if I turn to a snitch
But I'm 21 4L, ain’t no way I'ma switch

Break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down

Penitentiary chances just to make a couple bucks
My heart so cold I could put it in my cup
Gang vs. the world, me and my dawg, it was us
Then you went and wrote a statement, and that really fucked me up
My brother lost his life and it turned me to a beast
My brother got life and it turned me to the streets
I been through the storm and it turned me to a G
But the other side was sunny, I get paid to rap on beats

[J. Cole:]
Break it on down, I break it on down
I break it on down, I break it on down
Yeah, I just came from the A
I drove back home, six hour drive, six and a half
Before I left I stopped by to see my nigga 21 in the studio
He had two of his kids with him right in the studio, that's when I knew
You a stand up nigga, I love seein' shit like that

Question
How many faking they streams? (A lot)
Getting they plays from machines? (A lot)
I can see behind the smoke and mirrors
Niggas ain't really big as they seem (Hmm)
I never say anything (Nah), everybody got they thing (True)
Some niggas make millions, other niggas make memes (Hmm)
I'm on a money routine
I don't want smoke, I want cream
I don't want no more comparisons
This is a marathon and I’m aware
I been playing it back from a lack of promotions
I was never one for the bragging and boasting
I guess I was hoping the music would speak for itself, but the people want everything else
Ok, no problem, I’ll show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I'm batting a thousand
It’s got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
He call it ""a lot,"" I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
’Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
Dennis Smith, Jr. stay solid, my nigga
I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
When they thought that I wasn't gone pan out, I got a plan
They say that success is the greatest revenge, tell all your friends
Cole on a mission, cementin' the spot as the greatest that did it
Before it all ends, nigga

Lost Stars,Maroon 5,"Please don't see
Just a boy caught up in dreams and fantasies
Please see me
Reaching out for someone I can't see

Take my hand, let's see where we wake up tomorrow
Best laid plans sometimes are just a one night stand
I'll be damned, Cupid's demanding back his arrow
So let's get drunk on our tears

And God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?

Who are we?
Just a speck of dust within the galaxy?
Woe is me
If we're not careful turns into reality

But don't you dare let our best memories bring you sorrow
Yesterday I saw a lion kiss a deer
Turn the page, maybe we'll find a brand new ending
Where we're dancing in our tears

And God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?

And I thought I saw you out there crying
And I thought I heard you call my name
And I thought I heard you out there crying
Just the same

And God, give us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and this lamb is on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars trying to light ... light up the dark?

And I thought I saw you out there crying
And I thought I heard you call my name
And I thought I heard you out there crying
But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?
Are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?"

The Night We Met,Lord Huron,"I am not the only traveler
Who has not repaid his debt
I've been searching for a trail to follow again
Take me back to the night we met

And then I can tell myself
What the hell I'm supposed to do
And then I can tell myself
Not to ride along with you

I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Take me back to the night we met

When the night was full of terrors
And your eyes were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet
Oh, take me back to the night we met

I had all and then most of you
Some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Haunted by the ghost of you
Take me back to the night we met"

Devotion,Hillsong United,"I've been running, trying to be one who sees
I've been working, salvation out on my knees
There is nothing better than knowing
We are redeemed
I'm believing, trusting in Creative Hands,
I am praying for our world to bow to Your Plan
And this one thought is unmistakable
To take up my cross and follow You, Lord

When You stand, the tall tress and mountains bow
When You speak, the fiercest of oceans is still
And I see the sinner seek devotion
The lost become chosen, and I fall to my knees

I'm forgiven by a Saviour who did not deserve death
He was blameless and I was lost in shamefulness
I'm delivered, but it doesn't seem right
Unless I keep my eyes focused on the Saviour who gave His life
In the middle of a world that denies it believes
It is breaking apart at the very seams
There is one thing to be alive for
And it's to take up my cross and follow You, Lord

When You stand, the tall trees and mountains bow
When You speak, the fiercest of oceans is still
And I see the sinner seek devotion
The lost become chosen, and I fall to my knees

I will take up my cross and follow, Lord where You lead me
And I will take up my cross and follow wherever You go

When You stand, the tall trees and mountains bow
When You speak, the fiercest of oceans is still
And I see the sinner seek devotion
The lost become chosen, and I fall to my knees

Fall to my knees"
