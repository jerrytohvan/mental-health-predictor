Midsummer Madness,88rising,"[Joji:]
Last night, I lost all my patience
You were fucked up, I was wasted
Midsummer madness
I can't take it no more, no more
Fuck the ru-u-u-ules
Ru-u-u-ules
Ru-u-u-u-oh
Fuck the ru-u-u-ules
Ru-u-u-ules
Ru-u-u-u-oh

[AUGUST 08:]
Make it make sense
Make it make sense, I
Can't hide a heart in a black tint, I
You were off the bullshit and the tablets
Under 21, both savage
All these blurry nights feel the same to me
Heart full of hate, no vacancy
Only one you gonna to blame when it's over
Can't look me in my eyes when you sober
Hey, I'm the one you call when you feel alone
Running up a check just to help you cope
I just want to live in the moment
You just want to fight cause you lonely
Tryna see a milly then be really up
Rockstar crash in my Bentley truck
You need all my love
You've got all the love

[Joji:]
Last night, I lost all my patience
You were fucked up, I was wasted
Midsummer madness
I can't take it no more, no more
Fuck the ru-u-u-ules
Ru-u-u-ules
Ru-u-u-u-oh
Fuck the ru-u-u-ules
Ru-u-u-ules
Ru-u-u-u-oh

[Rich Brian:]
Uh, ayy, ayy, uh
Been a minute since I heard you wanna stay as friends
I'll learn from my mistakes, you make me want to learn again
I don't really see the problem, it's a risk I wanna take
You say ""let's see where it goes"" but I don't really wanna wait
Ayy, look and listen up
You've been smiling when we fuck
Let's not even think about it, we ain't gotta talk a lot
Make it hotter than the summer, I'll stay with you when it's not
Put the slow jams on, I wanna see you make it pop, ayy
Moving all around the bed like we just toss and turn, ayy
Playin' with the fire, I don't care if I get burned, ayy
I'ma treat you good like you've been waiting for your turn, ayy
Nothing in the universe feel better than your tongue, ayy
'Bout to go home, I know you finna come with
I'm playing these games like a pimp on the strip
Conversations late night about how we gonna live
I don't got the answer to it, all I'm finna say is...

[Joji (DZ):]
Fuck the ru-u-u-ules

[DZ:]
當光灑進了 white Porsche
I never felt so good
Call me DJ Knowknow, oh-oh no
播放列表歌很夠
你點頭我心裡會滿足
博物館給了更多感悟
在天文台半山道漫步
拼LA夜景的版圖
Fuck the rules
距離不是問題, I know
為了這一刻的feel我值得飛那麼久
She lookin' so pretty, I wanted a kiss
把beautiful memories 存入我的iPhone X
I,I,I hope 24 hours can become 48
看日落 粉的天 有藍月亮陪
想要擁抱 你在我需要前給
陽光明媚，我不在乎
Sunny gone, I don't care, you're my sunshine babe

[Joji:]
I don't feel control
Better on my own
I'm used to being so gone for way too long
Long, long, long

See The Light,Hillsong Worship,"Arise my soul
Remember this
He took my sin
And He buried it

No longer I who live
Now Jesus lives in me
For I was dead in sin
But I woke up to see the light

No I won't boast
But in the cross
That saved my soul
All else is loss

The grip of fear
Has no hold on me
So where, oh, death
Where is your sting

No longer I who live
Now Jesus lives in me
For I was dead in sin
But I woke up to see the light

All, all of this for your glory
All, all of this for your glory
All, all of this for your glory
All, all of this for your glory
All, all of this for your glory
All, all of this for your glory

No longer I who live
Now Jesus lives in me
For I was dead in sin
But I woke up to see the light

All, all of this for your glory

Goodness Of God,One Sonic Society,"I love You, Lord, oh, Your mercy never fails me
All my days I've been held in Your hands
From the moment that I wake up until I lay my head
I will sing of the goodness of God

All my life You have been faithful
And all my life You have been so, so good
With every breath that I am able
I will sing of the goodness of God

I love Your voice, You have led me through the fire
In darkest nights You are close like no other
I've known You as a father, I've known You as a friend
And I have lived in the goodness of God

And all my life You have been faithful
Yes, all my life You have been so, so good
With every breath that I am able
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God

Your goodness is running after, it's running after me
Your goodness is running after, it's running after me
With my life laid down, I'm surrendered now, I give You everything
Your goodness is running after, it's running after me
Your goodness is running after, it's running after me
Your goodness is running after, it's running after me
With my life laid down, I'm surrendered now, I give You everything

Now you want to say you're sorry
Now you want to call me crying
Now you gotta see me wilding
Now I'm the one that's lying
And I don't feel bad about it
It's exactly what you get
Stop interrupting my grinding

I can't believe I believed everything we had would last
So young and naive for me to think she was from your past
Foolish of me to dream while you cheat (With what?)
With loose women
It took me some time, but now I am strong

Because I realized I got
Me, myself, and I, that's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
(I see you, how did you do that so fast?)
(She has on my outfit ya'll)
Sang it
Me, myself, and I, that's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gon' my own best friend

Right ladies?
Yes

I left a note in the hallway
By the time you read it, I'll be far away
I'm far away
But I ain't fucking with nobody
Let's have a toast to the good life
Suicide before you see this tear fall down my eyes
Me and my baby, we gon' be alright
We gon' live a good life
Big homie better grow up
Me and my whoadies 'bout to stroll up
I see them boppers in the corner
They sneaking out the back door
He only want me when I'm not there
He better call Becky with the good hair
He better call Becky with the good hair"

Baby you're making a fool of me
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees
Cause baby you got me, you got me, oh you got me, you got me

I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two or three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
And I still don't understand
Just how your love could do what no one else can

Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (your love)

Hoping you'll save me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now (your love)
Looking so crazy in love

Bow Down (Homecoming Live),Beyonce,"Coachella
Thank ya'll so much for having us once again
I'm so honored to be on this stage tonight
And this next song is for all of my queens
Do we have any beautiful queens in the house tonight?
I want you to sing along if you know the lyrics
It's called Bow Down

I know when you were little girls
You dreamt of being in my world
Don't forget it, don't forget it
Respect that, bow down bitches
I took some time to live my life
But don't think I'm just his little wife
Don't get it twisted, get it twisted
This my shit, bow down bitches

Bow down, bow bow bow down
Bow down, bow bow bow down
Bow down, bow bow bow down
I'm so crown, bow bow bow down

I'm out that H-town
Coming, coming down
I'm coming down dripping candy on the ground
Coming down dripping candy on the ground"
With You (Paradoxology),Elevation Worship,"Beneath the surface
Of my anxious imagination
Beckons a calmness
That is found in You alone

It washes over
Every doubt, every imperfection
Jesus, Your presence
Is the comfort of my soul

There's nowhere I'd rather be
When You're singing over me
I just wanna be here with You
I'm lost in Your mystery
I'm found in Your love for me
I just wanna be here with You

Here in the waiting
I won't worry about tomorrow
No need to focus
On the things I can't control

All my attention
On the wonder of this moment
Jesus, your presence
Is the comfort of my soul

There's nowhere I'd rather be
When You're singing over me
I just wanna be here with You
I'm lost in Your mystery
I'm found in Your love for me
I just wanna be here with You

So let all that I am
Be consumed with who You are
All the glory of Your presence
What more could I ask for?

So let all that I am
Be consumed with who You are
All the glory of Your presence
What more could I ask for?

So let all that I am
Be consumed with who You are
All the glory of Your presence
What more could I ask for?

There's nowhere I'd rather be
When You're singing over me
I just wanna be here with You
I'm lost in Your mystery
I'm found in Your love for me
I just wanna be here with You"
In Love With You,Chris Tomlin,"I feel like singing now
My heart is free

You've forgiven me
Your name's the sweetest sound to my ears,
Lord hold me near

I'm in love, love with You
Like I never dreamed
I'm in love, love with You
And I'm flying free
From the things that tie me down
I'm walking on the ground
I'm in love, love with You

You're all I think about
Day and night all the time
How you make my world

Go 'round and make it stop
You're all I got"
Whole Heart (Hold Me Now),Hillsong United,"Hold me now
In the hands that created the heavens
Find me now
Where the grace runs as deep as Your scars
You pulled me from the clay
You set me on a rock
Called me by Your Name
And made my heart whole again

Lifted up
And my knees know it's all for Your glory
I might stand
With more reasons to sing than to fear
You pulled me from the clay
Set me on a rock
Called me by Your Name
And made my heart whole again

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

Once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds me now

And that grace
Owns the ground where the grave did
Where all my shame remains
Left for dead in Your wake
You crashed those age-old gates
You left no stone unturned
You stepped out of that grave
And shouldered me all the way

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

Once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds me now

Healed and forgiven
Look where my chains are now
Death has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds that ground
And Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

Once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds me now

Healed and forgiven
Look where my chains are now
Death has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds that ground
And Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now

Healed and forgiven
Look where my chains are now
Death has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds that ground
And Your grace holds me now

Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

Okie dokie, alkie, keep it lowkey like Thor lil bro
Or he'll go blow the loudy, saudy of sour Saudi
Wiley up off peyote, wilding like that coyote
If I sip any Henny, my belly just might be outie
Pull up inside a huggy, Starsky & Hutch a dougie
I just opened up the pack in an hour I'll ash my lucky
She just yelling ""fuck me""
Two weeks she'll be yelling fuck me
Tonight she just yelling ""fuck me""
Two weeks she'll be yelling fuck me
Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuckie
And Chuck E. Cheese's pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me
Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me
Oh generation above me, yeah, know you still remember me

Cigarettes on cigarettes
Cigarettes on cigarettes
Cigarettes on cigarettes

I will smoke a little something but I don't inhale
Everywhere that I go, everywhere they be asking how's it going
Say the going's well, go figure, Victor's light skinned
Jesus got me feeling like Colin Powell, all praise to the God
God knows he's a pro, he's a pro like COINTEL
Check, check mate, check me take me to the bedroom
Let me know me well, I mean normally
You see Norma Jean wouldn't kick it with Farmer Phil
But these kids these days, they get so high
Burn trees, smoke chlorophyll, 'til they can't feel

Got me feeling like Lauryn Hill, miseducated, my dick delegated
Rap Bill Bellamy, they said I shoulda never made it
Probably been dead or in jail
Deadbeat dad, enough of that jazz
Asshole, absinthe up in that glass
Are we there yet? Ice cubes in a bong
Rip, brain dead, take a tug then pass
Then pass

I think we all addicted
I think we all addicted, yeah

Best Years Of Our Lives,Baha Men,"I get such a thrill when you look in my eyes

Cause deep down inside all I wanted is you

Oh, makes me wanna dance
Oh, it's a new romance
Oh, I look into your eyes
Oh, best years of our lives

Oh girl I'm so thankful that you are still mine

You should try to respect
The way I mic check
When I'm rhyming on the shit
Put the lighter to the spliff
Life is just a [?], but it matters how you treat her
Love her fuck her cut and leave her
I need a lover who could be with me forever
Even if I never eat her I'm too hungry for these beats yo
I need more dough cause cash rule the globe
And if you didn't know now you know (now you know)

I put my hands up, not for the local hip hop
But to the ozone hoping I could find the gods
Climbing to the top got me shining by the brow
Sweat means you're working hard enough to feel the crowd
Feel me now, hear me now
I am really who I say I am
Your biggest fan [?] and I'm not [?]
And you're not Eminem this is hip hop
B-bop, Jazz R&B, Rock n Roll black music

I found a way to control
Where I go

I used to fly so high, I thought I'd never come down
'Til one day I found out what it's really 'bout
If you don't do it now it will never happen
I used to think I was forever rappin' til I met a 'has-been'
You lose some magic every time you use it
So don't abuse it or you'll end up as a one-hit poof-then
Who's him? No one knows
Used to blaze flows, from the back of his throat but it's been years since we've seen him glow
Do you need the needle or do you fiend for the wax
Me, I bleed on tracks, Sol, be a junkie for rap
Fuck that other shit, never touch nothin' but the pen
'Til the end, and if you see me again, my friend
Know that nothin' ever changes but the weather and the trends
And even them, they really mean nothing in the end
What was it that I said before? Oh
I found a way to control, if it's soul let me flow like

I found a way to control
Where I go

See, no matter how high, I always find a way to ride... na'mean?

Yeah... yeah...
Piano mane

It's like I only got a few more years to live
Because the window in this game is small and it closes quick
And on top of that I swear to God everybody raps
But only a chosen few support the local cats
They cut my lights out last week I'm working like a factory
A thousand CD's at a time I'm in these streets
Begging for ears to hear my blood sweat and tears
Took a couple years but in a second they dismiss
Even when I flow sick ""Sol's this
What did you expect? The same kid?"" Na I'm grown and shit
And I'm better than ya'll now
I'm fed up with ya'll now
I'm goin to get my cheddar get the fuck up or stand down
Tryna find a way to bring the corners from all around
Hold together singing the same song and sing it loud
Feel the sound from underground
Harriet Tubman style
Quit fuckin' around this is more than just a town
Let's make this money now
Control the market now
Marcus Garvey style fuck the A and R on top will knock em down
Search his pockets take my scrilla back

'Bout all the ""he said, she said"" bullshit
So pick your poison love
Let's go somewhere a little more exclusive
Take a shot, take a chance, take my hand boy
Tension so intense like an asteroid
Be discreet, gotta dodge all the tabloids

Let's not think too much, there ain't no problems
As long as we keep this

Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, lowkey
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
You ain't even gotta lo-, lo-, lo-, lo-, lo-, lo-, lo-, love me
(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah)
Us on a king size, keep it a secret
Say I'm your queen, I don't wanna leave this
Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, lowkey"

Whole Heart (Hold Me Now),Hillsong United,"Hold me now
In the hands that created the heavens
Find me now
Where the grace runs as deep as Your scars
You pulled me from the clay
You set me on a rock
Called me by Your Name
And made my heart whole again

Lifted up
And my knees know it's all for Your glory
I might stand
With more reasons to sing than to fear
You pulled me from the clay
Set me on a rock
Called me by Your Name
And made my heart whole again

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

Once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds me now

And that grace
Owns the ground where the grave did
Where all my shame remains
Left for dead in Your wake
You crashed those age-old gates
You left no stone unturned
You stepped out of that grave
And shouldered me all the way

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

Once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds me now

B-Boyz,Birdman,"[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Talk about it, make 'em talk about
Life to me is currency, prosperity, I got it
And your life to me is lifeless, like its livin' on life support
I license everything in my wallet, lightest boy with the biggest heart
Nigga play your part or parallel park your ego, next to me and violence
Next to me is definitely no one, I'm one of one
And I musta won that from anybody who had it, or better yet forgot it
Mack in the back of a 'Lac, with a mac in the back of the 'Lac
With a latch on the back of the trunk
Hit a punk in the back with a pump, in the back, 'till he's off balance
And I'm back in the front of the front of the future when you are mentioning talent
And I'm in the back in the back of the block with a cop, wanna cop anybody's allowance
Iraq on the block, he watch for the block or whatever
And cut, no cut, more guns, more guts, fuck boy, you fucked up twice, you fuck, consider you drownin'
Die in a lake with a date with a catfish, back flip head first smilin'
C-cry in the face of Jesus, we just pray we keep on stylin'
On you bitches, TDE, YMCMB business, bitch

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
Okay nigga riding in a May-be, and I'm probably with baby
Dont talk nigga fuck you pay me, intercept your bitch like Bailey
Okay big money on this side, 100 grand for the whip my bitch drive
Need a new save money getting too high, dead presidents all in my Levis
Boy I swear this nigga be swagging, and I'm living lavish
Might cop me an Aston, Martin on 'em
Anything I drive I own 'em, bad bitch and that ass ain't normal
Gotta put that pound game on her, beat it up she deep in a coma
I'm super paid, 2 shows a day
My rollie gold, no time to waste
What it do Berg, my fuckin' brother
Keep that pistol by me like my lovely momma
Hot as the summer, cold as the winter
Stay on them charts, I heard that they plotting my timber
Young nigga, got a lot of flows
Any nigga don't believe me, I make it look easy easy out of control

[Verse 3: Birdman]
Box full of choppers, hand on the trigger
Uptown gangsta, get it how we get it
Third Ward soldier, suicide rider
Militant minded, hundred mill on the counter
Hand pearly rug nigga, flame on the Bugatti
Christian Louboutin, Chanel for my models
Higher than Bugatti nigga, fishing on the fish scales
Nose diving for them hundreds, strapped up making mail
Fr-fresher than I been before
Higher than we even been, shining on them 24's
Junior doing time ho
On the grind ho, while he doing time ho

[Interlude: Mack Maine]
Ya know!
The time is money and money still was made baby
Eight months ain't stop nothing nigga
It's like jail was third base and my lil' nigga still came home, ya understand

[Verse 4: Mack Maine]
I'm from the hood where bitches hold coke in they baby diapers
That's why when the babies grow up damn they be like us
I came a long ways from rhyming up in crazy cyphers
Man I'm so happy my lil' brother came home from Rikers
Shout out to BP, Thugga, Flow and Fail Boy
My flow Lucifer, I spit hell boy
My heart numb, ain't no pain I can't withstand
And I hold my niggas down boy like a kickstand
Get off my nuts, stop acting like a bitch fam
Lil' nigga finish puberty, grow ya own dick damn
I went from watching time fly on Earl and Red porch
To cruising through the streets of Miami in a red Porsche
Me and Stunna fly, we should join the Air Force
Stand up niggas, the fuck you brought them chairs for?
I went from making money from people with crack habits
To thanking God I'm in a whole 'nother tax bracket
Amen"
Slip The Noose,The Maine,"Breakdown hysteric and young
Uncomfortably numb
Then you sent my pain into oblivion
I was on the verge of breaking down
Then you came around
And not a second too late

Well give two fingers to the person that I used to be
You shook the noose, slipped my head loose and now that boy is history
And you see that I knew better, yeah I knew better
Than to refuse your hand you rescued me from myself

Oh, just slip the noose
Untie the rope from my wrists
I was about to let go
'Til I knew you existed

Breakdown hysteric and young
Uncomfortably numb
Then you sent my pain into oblivion
I was on the verge of breaking down
Then you came around
And not a second too late

Well loneliness is hell and you're alone but I can tell you
That it's everything you need because it brought you right to me
And now you see that I knew better, yeah I knew better
Than to refuse your hand you rescued me from myself

Oh, just slip the noose
Untie the rope from my wrists

Every Little Thing (Remix),Hillsong Young & Free,"Every little thing-ing-ing

Your favour waits within the future
My dreams are small compared to Yours
Why should I worry 'bout tomorrow when I know
That all I gotta do is trust You, Lord

Every little thing is gonna be alright
Every little thing is gonna be just fine
Whether I can see it now
I know You will work it out for good
Every little thing, everything will be alright

Behind the scenes and in the details
You plan the perfect way for me
Why would I dwell upon the road's uncertainties
When all I gotta do is look to You
Yeah, all I gotta do is look to You

Every little thing is gonna be alright
Every little thing is gonna be just fine
Whether I can see it now
I know You will work it out for good
Every little thing, everything will be alright

Every little thing, every little thing
Every little thing, everything will be alright

[Andy Mineo:]
Hey God, I know You don't need no one to advise You
You probably do a better job running the world than I do
I just thought I'd remind You
I've been trying to find You
It felt like Satan working overtime, times two
They say if it doesn't kill ya that refines you
But I'm trying to live, and that's bigger than survival
It's been a long night
It's been a long fight
So just remind me now
Everything will be alright

Every little thing, every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing, everything will be alright"

Another In The Fire,Hillsong United,"There's a grace when the heart is under fire
Another way when the walls are closing in
And when I look at the space between
Where I used to be and this reckoning
I know I will never be alone

There was another in the fire
Standing next to me
There was another in the waters
Holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding
Of how I've been set free
There is a cross that bears the burden
Where another died for me

There is another in the fire

All my debt left for dead beneath the waters
I'm no longer a slave to my sin anymore
And should I fall in the space between
What remains of me and this reckoning
Either way I won't bow to the things of this world

'Cause I know

And I know I will never be alone

There is another in the fire
Standing next to me
There is another in the waters
Holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding
What power set me free
There is a grave that holds no body
And now that power lives in me

There is another in the fire
There is another in the fire
There is another in the fire
There is another in the fire

I can see

And I can see the light in the darkness
As the darkness bows to Him
I can hear the roar in the heavens
As the space between wears thin

I can feel the ground shake beneath us
As the prison walls cave in
Nothing stands between us
Nothing stands between us

And there is no other name
But the name that is Jesus
He who was and still is
And will be through it all
So come what may in the space between
All the things unseen
And this reckoning
I know I will never be alone

I know. Come on
I know I will never be alone

There'll be another in the fire
Standing next to me
There'll be another in the waters
Holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding
How good You've been to me
I'll count the joy come every battle
'Cause I know that's where You'll be

I can see the light

And I can see the light in the darkness
As the darkness bows to Him
I can hear the roar in the heavens
As the space between wears thin

I can feel the ground shake beneath us
As the prison walls cave in
Nothing stands between us
Nothing stands between

There'll be another in the fire
Standing next to me
There'll be another in the waters
Holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding
How good You've been to me
I'll count the joy come every battle
'Cause I know that's where You'll be

Count the joy come every battle
'Cause I know that's where You'll be
Count the joy come every battle
'Cause I know that's where You'll be
