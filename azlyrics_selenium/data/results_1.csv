Here Again (Paradoxology),Elevation Worship,"Can't go back to the beginning
Can't control what tomorrow will bring
But I know here in the middle
Is the place where You promise to be

I'm not enough unless You come
Will You meet me here again?
'Cause all I want is all You are
Will You meet me here again?

As I walk now through the valley
Let Your love rise above every fear
Like the sun shaping the shadow
In my weakness, Your glory appears

I'm not enough unless You come
Will You meet me here again?
'Cause all I want is all You are
Will You meet me here again?
I'm not enough unless You come
Will You meet me here again?
'Cause all I want is all You are
Will You meet me here again?

Not for a minute was I forsaken
The Lord is in this place
The Lord is in this place
Come Holy Spirit, dry bones awaken
The Lord is in this place
The Lord is in this place
Not for a minute was I forsaken
The Lord is in this place
The Lord is in this place
Come Holy Spirit, dry bones awaken
The Lord is in this place
The Lord is in this place
How awesome is this place
How awesome is this place
I know the Lord is in this place
The Lord is in this place
Oh, the Lord is in this place
Oh, the Lord is in this place

I'm not enough unless You come
Will You meet me here again?
'Cause all I want is all You are
Will You meet me here again?"
The Stand,Hillsong United,"You stood before creation
Eternity in your hand
You spoke the earth into motion
My soul now to stand

You stood before my failure
And carried the cross for my shame
My sin weighed upon your shoulders
My soul now to stand

So what can I say?
And what can I do?
But offer this heart, Oh God
Completely to you

So I'll walk upon salvation
Your spirit alive in me
This life to declare your promise
My soul now to stand

So what can I say?
And what can I do?
But offer this heart, Oh God
Completely to you

I'll stand
With arms high and heart abandoned
In awe of the one who gave it all
I'll stand
My soul Lord to you surrendered
All I am is yours"
Darth Vader vs Adolf Hitler 3,Epic Rap Battles Of History,"[Adolf Hitler:]
Vader... This is your last chance... Battle me... or die...

Epic rap battles of history!
Darth Vader!
Versus!
Adolf Hitler!
Begin!

[Adolf Hitler:]
Screw you, you big black cunt!
I'll kick your balls and your face! A war on two fronts!
The Führer will crush the Dark Side! Like a rap Apartheid!
I put the germ in the Germany! I'm sick on this mic!
I beat you twice, you sellout, now you bow down to Mickey Mouse
You call yourself a Dark Lord? You couldn't even conquer Space Mountain!
You're just a sad asthmatic robot freak who needs some loving
Well I baked you something, here, pop into my oven!

[Darth Vader:]
Let me paint you a picture, son
Potrait of a bitch after World War One
You were stirring up the fears of the German people
Telling the world that the Jews are evil
You wrote a little book, got'em fired up
Had a Beer Hall Putsch, got'em fired up
When your bunker started getting fired up
You put a gun in your mouth and fired up!
You dumb motherfucker, didn't Napoleon let you know?
When you conquer Russia, better pack some fucking winter clothes!
While you're fighting off Valkyrie
I got a million clones, they die for me
My bounty hunters ride for me
Yo homeboy, finish this rhyme for me!

[Boba Fett:]
They call me Boba Fett, you wanna mess with me?
I'll put my balls in your mouth like boba tea
I got a jetpack, yo, you know I steal the show!
Cause when I rock the microphone I-

[Adolf Hitler:]
Oh, Sieg Hell No!
You're not going to cheat me, Mister Sunglasses All the Time!
I'll take you and your new boyfriend Goofy and all your spermy soldier guys!
And throw you in a butthole in the sand!
I am Adolf!... Hitler...

Who won?
Who's next?
You decide!
Eeeeeepic rap! battles! of history!"
Ghost,Au/Ra & Alan Walker,"Today I'm kinda feelin' like a ghost
Call my friends but ain't nobody home
Tell myself I'm fine, but I don't really know
I'm just scared that I'll end up
I'll end up, I'll end up alone

I never let it show
But I feel like a missed call on a phone
Tryna live my life pay as you go
But I'm so scared that I'll end up
I'll end up, I'll end up alone

You know I'm like a ghost
Sometimes I have to fade
And it haunts me that I have to be this way
You say it's gone cold
I say I'll do better
But I always seem to disappear again
You know I'm like a ghost
I see it in your face
And it haunts me that I have to be this way
You say it's gone cold
I say I'll do better
But I always seem to disappear again
You know I'm like a ghost...

You know I never meant to cut you off
Got phantom feelings I can never stop
Stranger things to worry 'bout I know
But I'm so scared that I'll end up
I'll end up, I'll end up alone

I can't see myself in the mirror
Does that mean I'm not really here?
I'm losin' touch with everything I know
And I'm so scared that I'll end up
I'll end up, I'll end up alone

You know I'm like a ghost
Sometimes I have to fade
And it haunts me that I have to be this way
You say it's gone cold
I say I'll do better
But I always seem to disappear again
You know I'm like a ghost
I see it in your face
And it haunts me that I have to be this way
You say it's gone cold
I say I'll do better
But I always seem to disappear again
You know I'm like a ghost

You know I'm like a ghost...
Ooh, I'll be OK
I'll be alright
I know, Ooh, I'll be OK

I'm just scared that I'll end up alone

You know I'm like a ghost
I see it in your face
And it haunts me that I have to be this way
You say it's gone cold
I say I'll do better
But I always seem to disappear again
You know I'm like a ghost"
Bad Guy,Billie Eilish & Justin Bieber,"White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows

Bruises on both my knees for you

My soul so cynical

I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone

Cause I'm a good dude, take pride in that,
Need good lovin', I'm providin' that,
Understand that I'm worldwide,

Down like her temperature, cause
To me she zero degree,
She's cold, overfreeze,

Now she my Miss America,
Now can I be her soldier, please,

On a battlefield of love,

His arrows from above,
Don't you ever leave the side of me,
Indefinitely, not probably,
And honestly I'm down like economy,
Yeahhhhhh

Something Just Like This,Nicole Cross,"I've been reading books of old
The legends and a myths
Achilles and his gold
Hercules and his gifts
Spiderman's control
And Batman with his fists
And clearly I don't see myself upon that list

She said, Where d'you wanna go?
How much you wanna risk?
I'm not looking for somebody
With some superhuman gifts
Some superhero
Some fairytale bliss
Just something I can turn to
Somebody I can kiss

The moon and its eclipse
And Superman unrolls
A suit before he lifts
But I'm not the kind of person that it fits

How much you wanna risk?

This Feeling,The Chainsmokers,"I'll tell you a story before it tells itself
I lay out all my reasons, you say that I need help
We all got expectations, and sometimes they go wrong
But no one listens to me, so I put it in this song

They tell me think with my head, not that thing in my chest
They got their hands at my neck this time
But you're the one that I want, if that's really so wrong
Then they don't know what this feeling is like

I tell you all my secrets, and you tell all your friends
Hold on to your opinions, and stand by what you say (stand by what you say)
In the end, it's my decision, so it's my fault when it ends

They tell me think with my head, not that thing in my chest

What else is there to say?
Except for a couple more things
It's Social Club baby

[Martymar:]
The game done changed since we last dropped
Number three on Billboard, recorded off my laptop
The last three girls didn't work out on some bad luck
Five CDs, 80 tracks later better catch up
And if you see where I should be, it doesn't add up
All grace everything and Social Club's the mascot
It feels good to live your dreams when they were doubting you
When you say hello to them, it makes 'em change they attitude
For everybody talking I ain't mad at you
I promise God can use us both, but don't make him embarrass you
That's just how it goes, living in better clothes
And every holiday I see a text you better show
I been traveling but I said I'll be coming home
They say Marty you ain't good enough
I guess now we know
Been in the sky so much my ears don't even pop
No more features for rappers unless we're getting cuts
No cuts on splits I'm on my producer tip
Love God and love people, I promise to never switch

Bold with my words stand firm, brothers don't test me

Flowed on 'em seven minutes straight, told 'em flight school
I hit Florida one year after Jordan emerged
The greatest I've ever seen, and me not so bad with the words
I haven't written a sixteen without mentioning God (haven't)
I don't know what ya'll mean when ya'll sending them shots
Cammie told me that Santino gon' rap too
Straight to the league, next LeBron outta high school
We make the music for them kids on the city bus
Latch key baby's parents come from the 80's, bruh
From MIA (MIA), down to LAX (LAX)
Truthfully we the only ones who can say we next
Cause we're independent (yes), talking technically (technically)

I Miss The Days,NF,"I miss the days when
I had a smile on my face and
Wasn't so caught up in all of the small things
Wasn't so adamant that I could handle everything alone
And wasn't so cautious, and always exhausted
And actually listened to things that my heart said, heart said
Ridin' my bike, just ridin' my bike
Not overthinkin' my life
Not always wonderin' if I'm a likable person
Or someone that nobody likes
Not always stressin' 'bout money
Or losin' my job or scared I ain't makin' the flight
Not always going to bed every night
With this knot in my stomach that never unwinds

What happened to me? Yeah, what happened to me?
When did I start to believe I wasn't worth it
And question my purpose to breath?
Wonderin' who I should be, happiness outta my reach
Scared to get back on my feet
Need to get rid of what's detrimental
But it's hard to let go
When the thing that hurt you helped you get to your dream
See, I miss the days when I wasn't so faded
Love wasn't always invasive, I could embrace it
Just innocent, waitin', not always living in anguish
When did I break and become over taken?
What was the moment I caved and gave away all of my faith
And made a replacement? I miss the days when, I miss the days when

I miss the smiles we had when we were young
I miss the memories of feeling love
I miss us runnin' underneath the sun
Staring out the window when the rain would come
I miss the smiles we had when we were kids, yeah
I feel like life was so much simpler then, yeah
When we had joy and we were innocent
I'd give it all to feel that way again, way again

Gimme my mind back, yeah, gimme my mind back
The one that told me I was worth something when I fall flat, yeah fall flat
The one that told me I was worth something when I'm off track
Back when my imagination wasn't in a cage
And it was free to run fast
Yeah, gimme my mind back, gimme my-gimme my mind back
Before it was hi-jacked and wasn't described as
A place of limitation always indicating I can't
Handle everything from my past
Handed anything it dissects
Till I'm depressed, I know I'm blessed
But I'm cursed too

Take me back when, I was happy but I wasn't acting
Vulnerable but didn't see it like some kinda weakness
Or a thing that's unattractive
Had emotion but I learned to mask it
Didn't know what I was running after
Didn't know the older I would grow the more I lose control
And takin' all the baggage, it's really sad when
Everything you thought was stable crashes
Everything you thought would take the sadness
Really only made it deeper, got me off the deep end askin'
Will we ever feel like we imagine?
Will we ever feel like we adapted?
Will we ever feel like we did back then?
Just take me back when, just take me back when

I miss the smiles we had when we were young
I miss the memories of feeling love
I miss us runnin' underneath the sun
Staring out the window when the rain would come
I miss the smiles we had when we were kids, yeah
I feel like life was so much simpler then, yeah
When we had joy and we were innocent
I'd give it all to feel that way again, way again

Yeah

Yeah
I miss the smiles we had when we were young
I miss the memories of feeling love
I miss us runnin' underneath the sun
Staring out the window when the rain would come
I miss the smiles we had when we were kids, yeah
I feel like life was so much simpler then, yeah
When we had joy and we were innocent
I'd give it all to feel that way again, way again"

Dancing With Your Ghost,Sasha Sloan,"Yelling at the sky
Screaming at the world
Baby, why'd you go away?
I'm still your girl
Holding on too tight
Head up in the clouds
Heaven only knows
Where you are now

How do I love
How do I love again?
How do I trust
How do I trust again?

I stay up all night
Tell myself I'm alright
Baby, you're just harder to see than most
I put the record on
Wait till I hear our song
Every night I'm dancing with your ghost
Every night I'm dancing with your ghost

Never got the chance
To say a last goodbye
I gotta move on
But it hurts to try

How do I love
How do I love again?
How do I trust
How do I trust again?

I stay up all night
Tell myself I'm alright
Baby, you're just harder to see than most
I put the record on
Wait till I hear our song
Every night I'm dancing with your ghost
Every night I'm dancing with your ghost

How do I love

Fade,James Arthur,"One day, one day,
One day, it all will fade
One day, one day,
One day, it all will fade
Empty moments, sleepless nights
Think about you every night
Wondering what went wrong
What we had once seemed so right
But just as quick you’re out of sight
You talk to me with words like moving on

Did it seem so simple to you?
Was I just another thing for you to do?
Did you ever mean the things you said?
Or was I just another notch on your bed?

I thought you needed me too
I thought your feelings were true
I thought your head was in my space
But now you’ve proven me wrong
But I will rise and be strong
And one day soon this pain will fade

One day, one day,
One day, it all will fade
I just wanted things to be so good
A simple life just simple love
Something hard to find these days
But you thought life owes you more than this
With your magazines and shopping trips
One day your beauty will fade

Did it seem so simple to you?
Was I just another thing for you to do?
Did you ever mean the things you said?
Was I just another notch on your bed?

I thought you needed me too
I thought your feelings were true
I thought your head was in my space
But now you’ve proven me wrong
But I will rise and be strong
And one day soon this pain will fade

I thought you needed me too
I thought your feelings were true
I thought your head was in my space
But now you’ve proven me wrong
And I will rise and be strong
And one day soon this pain will fade

One day, one day,
One day, it all will fade"
Certain Things,James Arthur,"[Verse:]
Something about you
It's like an addiction
Hit me with your best shot honey
I've got no reason to doubt you
'Cause certain things hurt
And you're my only virtue
And I'm virtually yours

[Pre-Chorus:]
And you keep coming back, coming back again
Keep running round, running round, running round my head

[Chorus:]
And there's certain things that I adore
And there's certain things that I ignore
But I'm certain that I'm yours
Certain that I'm yours
Certain that I'm yours

[Verse:]
There's something about you
It's when you get angry
You have me at your mercy
And you're like the shoulder to turn to
'Cause certain things mend us when we're hanging on for dear life
We held on so tight

[Pre-Chorus:]
And you keep coming back, coming back again
Keep running round, running round, running round my head

[Chorus x2:]
And there's certain things that I adore
And there's certain things that I ignore
But I'm certain that I'm yours
Certain that I'm yours
Certain that I'm yours

I adore you... I adore you...
Certain that I'm yours"
King Of The Clouds,Panic! At The Disco,"Heaven knows that I'm born too late for these ghosts that I chase
With these dreams, I inflate, painted skies in my brain
Every day, I'm Carl Sagan in space
To escape this old world, this old world

Some days I lie wide awake 'til the Sun hits my face
And I fade, elevate from the Earth
Far away to a place where I'm free from the weight
This old world, this old world

I don't trust anything
Or anyone, below the Sun
And I don't feel anything
At all

I'm King of the clouds, of the clouds
I get lifted, I get lifted
King of the clouds, of the clouds
I get lifted, I get lifted

Some only live to die, I'm alive to fly higher
Than angels in outfields inside of my mind
I'm ascending these ladders, I'm climbin', say goodbye
This old world, this old world

And when I fall to rise with stardust in my eyes
In the backbone of night, I'm combustible
Dust in the fire when I can't sleep a wink, I'm too tired
This old world, this old world

I don't trust anything
Or anyone, below the Sun
And I don't feel anything
At all

I'm King of the clouds, of the clouds
I get lifted, I get lifted
King of the clouds, of the clouds
I get lifted, I get lifted
Imagination, take me somewhere I don't know
I'm lost but I better find it alone
King of the clouds, of the clouds
I get lifted, I get lifted

I keep searching
Oh, I keep searching
I keep searching"

[No Rome:]
Took a picture of all my flaws
Or you can take a video on your phone
And you know that I would talk
But I'm too afraid to pick you up and go home
I'm feeling Dazed like a magazine
Finding my own sanity
Wishing it'll all go away
Now we're smoking off the balcony
You're telling me profanities
Maybe it was never okay

345, that's where we stayed
She told me I'm a narcissist doing it again
Took a bunch of acid and she told me, not again
Now I've gotta tell her that I'm lovin' her friends

And I've been seeing somebody
But I've not found a way to tell you
That I'm seeing somebody
There's not a nice way for me to say that
I've been seeing somebody
You know I want you to be happy
Since I'm seeing somebody
And then maybe we can get on with it

[No Rome:]
Stay out late, I just wanna get stoned
Telling all your friends that I'm never at home
And my face filling up with blood
But you're still saying they don't like your bourgeois
Coughing up the promethazine
Living like an evergreen
Sorry for the things that I've done
Now Selena won't be friends with me
I was kissing Emily
I love you, it was never your fault

restless soul,flor,"When you're alone
Do you feel the sadness?
It falls away
Then sneak inside and cloud my vision
It takes its toll, it gives me to the darkness
And it's hard to keep my light from burning out

Oh don't you tire your restless soul
You're running, you're running oh
In place, you're going nowhere fast, you know
Calm and lay down your restless soul
You're wearing
You're wearing out
No currents coming from your restless soul

I'm sure you know
I've been looking for answers
But I'm searching in the lost and quiet places
Oh and you know
I'm never going to find truth
When I'm asking in a crowd of foreign faces

Oh don't you tire your restless soul
You're running, you're running
Oh in place, you're going nowhere fast, you know
Calm and lay down your restless soul

I filled your cup until it overflowed
Took it so far to keep you close (Keep you close)
I was afraid to leave you on your own

[Halsey (both):]
I said I'd catch you if you fall (Fall)
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (All)
And then I got you off your knees
Put you right back on your feet
Just so you could take advantage of me

Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
Feeling so high, but too far away to hold me
You know I'm the one who put you up there
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
Thinking you could live without me
Thinking you could live without me

Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why)
Thinking you could live without me
Live without me
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
I don't know why (I don't know why, yeah, yeah)

Gave love 'bout a hundred tries (Hundred tries)
Just running from the demons in your mind
Then I took yours and made 'em mine (Mine)

I'm sad inside, but I know it's for the best, right?
You had to realize where you drew the line
I would cross the line a thousand times
You've got what I need, bae I need your spotlight
Along the lines of social suicide
I refuse to die
Not by your side
So I'll take what I can from you, then I'll hide
And save the lucid dreams for another time
I still hate it when you're not there
I know I should, I know I should, but no I don't care
I still hate it when you're not there
This life's not fair, took advantage up there

Rising up to take their place

I see a near revival
Stirring as we pray and seek
We're on our knees
We're on our knees

Heal my heart and make it clean
Open up my eyes to the things unseen
Show me how to love like You have loved me

Break my heart for what breaks Yours
Everything I am for Your kingdom's cause
As I walk from earth into eternity

Hosanna in the highest"
King Of Kings,Hillsong Worship,"In the darkness
We were waiting
Without hope
Without light
Till from heaven
You came running
There was mercy in Your eyes
To fulfil the law and prophets
To a virgin came the word
From a throne of endless glory
To a cradle in the dirt

Praise the Father
Praise the Son
Praise the Spirit
Three in one
God of glory
Majesty
Praise forever to the King of Kings

To reveal the kingdom coming
And to reconcile the lost
To redeem the whole creation
You did not despise the cross
For even in your suffering
You saw to the other side
Knowing this was our salvation
Jesus for our sake you died

Praise the Father
Praise the Son
Praise the Spirit
Three in one
God of glory
Majesty
Praise forever to the King of Kings

And the morning that You rose
All of heaven held its breath
Till that stone was moved for good
For the Lamb had conquered death
And the dead rose from their tombs
And the angels stood in awe
For the souls of all who'd come
To the Father are restored
And the church of Christ was born
Then the Spirit lit the flame
Now this gospel truth of old
Shall not kneel
Shall not faint
By His blood and in His name
In His freedom I am free
For the love of Jesus Christ
Who has resurrected me

Praise the Father
Praise the Son
Praise the Spirit
Three in one

Tell The World,Hillsong United,"Don't want to stand here and shout Your praise
And walk away and forget Your Name
I'll stand for you if it's all I do
Cause there is none that compare to You

Cause all I want in this lifetime is You
And all i want in this whole world is you

Tell the world that Jesus lives
Tell the world that, tell the world that
Tell the world that he died for them
Tell the world that he lives again

No longer I but Christ in me
Cause it's the truth that set me free
How could this world be a better place?
But by thy mercy and by thy grace

C'mon, c'mon we'll tell the world about You
C'mon, c'mon we'll tell the world about You

Tell the world that Jesus lives
Tell the world that, tell the world that
Tell the world that he died for them
Tell the world that he lives again

C'mon, c'mon we'll tell the world about You
Tell the world that
Tell the world that
C'mon, c'mon we'll tell the world about You
Tell the world that
Tell the world that

Reckless Love,Cory Asbury,"Before I spoke a word, You were singing over me
You have been so, so good to me
Before I took a breath, You breathed Your life in me
You have been so, so kind to me

Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God
Oh, it chases me down, fights 'til I'm found, leaves the ninety-nine
I couldn't earn it, and I don't deserve it, still, You give Yourself away
Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God

When I was Your foe, still Your love fought for me
You have been so, so good to me
When I felt no worth, You paid it all for me
You have been so, so kind to me

Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God
Oh, it chases me down, fights 'til I'm found, leaves the ninety-nine
I couldn't earn it, and I don't deserve it, still, You give Yourself away
Oh, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love of God, yeah

There's no shadow You won't light up
Mountain You won't climb up
Coming after me
There's no wall You won't kick down
Lie You won't tear down
Coming after me

There's no shadow You won't light up
Mountain You won't climb up
Coming after me
There's no wall You won't kick down
Lie You won't tear down
Coming after me

A Great Big World (Say Something),Futuristic,"[Hook - Jerrin Jaramillo:]
Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'll be the one if you want me to
And anywhere I would've followed you
And say something, I'm giving up on you

[Verse - Futuristic:]
A lot of stress, she was a mess and I cleaned it up
You needed stuff and I needed something a little different
Say something, say anything, make a face, hold my hand
Kiss my lips to show that you really is committed
Four years is a lot of time, should we dismiss it?
Forget it and live as if it never existed
Emotions, I'm hopeless, it came to grow consistent
Turned a friendship into love, but now that love is sort of distant
I never thought I'd see the day I couldn't make you laugh
Couldn't make you smile, couldn't even make you mad
It's kind of like you're a cast or a mold
Or something from the past that I used to have
I'd do anything to get you back
And you would do anything just to get me back
I guess that's how it is
They say it's better to have loved and lost
But now I feel lost and I don't wanna live
Say something, say that you forgive me
Tell me that you believe me
Have faith that we can make it, I know that it won't be easy
But we could find a way back into that passion
Feel the word love and get lost in the meaning
Put you before me, your wants and your needs
My dreams include every bit of you
I wouldn't say it if it wasn't true
All you gotta do is tell me that you love me too
Say something

[Hook - Jerrin Jaramillo:]
Say something, I'm giving up on you
And I will swallow my pride
You're the one that I love
And I'm saying goodbye
And say something, I'm giving up on you
I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
And anywhere I would've followed you
And say something, I'm giving up on you
Say something, I'm giving up on you
Say something"
2nd Guess,Emily King,"I'll be the one to love you when there's no one else around
Be the one to hold you when the others let you down
I know it sounds crazy, I know we just met
Life is always sweeter when there's no regrets

We can plan a holiday somewhere nice and warm
I can be your everything, shelter from the storm
Yeah, there's something 'bout ya, it's hard to forget
Life is always sweeter when there's no regrets

Oh why, why not take chances?
Oh why can't we let these hearts go?
This could be a moment, something worth holding onto
Oh why miss a connection?
Oh why don't we listen when we both know
This is something special, and I don't wanna think it through
There's no second-guessing you

I can make you happy, never ever sad
Never ever treat you like you're not the best
Did somebody hurt you? Drag your heart around?
I can lift you up if you let your guard down

Tell me all your secrets, I'll tell you all my crimes
Start with the confession, then toss it all aside
Oh, there's something 'bout you that's hard to forget
Life is always sweeter when there's no regrets

Oh why, why not take chances?
Oh why can't we let these hearts go?
This could be a moment, something worth holding onto
Oh why miss a connection?
Oh why don't we listen when we both know
This is something special, and I don't wanna think it through
No second-guessing you

I take my chances when they find me
(No thinking twice, thinking twice, got to roll the dice now)
I've seen too many fall behind me
I don't wanna lose you right now, oh-ooh

Oh why, why not take chances?
Oh why don't we listen when we both know
This is something special, and I don't wanna think it through"

Paris In The Rain,Lauv,"All I know is
We could go anywhere, we could do
Anything, girl, whatever the mood we're in
Yeah, all I know is
Getting lost late at night under stars
Finding love standing right where we are
Your lips, they pull me in the moment
You and I alone and
People may be watching, I don't mind

'Cause anywhere with you feels right
Anywhere with you feels like Paris in the rain, Paris in the rain
We don't need a fancy town or bottles that we can't pronounce
'Cause anywhere babe is like Paris in the rain
When I'm with you, when I'm with you
Paris in the rain, Paris in the rain

I look at you now and I want this forever
I might not deserve it but there's nothing better
Don't know how I ever did it all without you
My heart is about to, about to jump out of my chest
Feelings, they come and they go, that they do
Feelings, they come and they go, not with you
The late nights and the street lights and the people
Look at me girl and the whole world could stop

Anywhere with you feels right
Anywhere with you feels like Paris in the rain, Paris in the rain
We don't need a fancy town or bottles that we can't pronounce
'Cause anywhere babe is like Paris in the rain
When I'm with you, when I'm with you
Paris in the rain, Paris in the rain, oh

Girl when I'm not with you
All I do is miss you
So come and set the mood right underneath the moonlight
Days in Paris, nights in Paris
Paint you with my eyes closed
Wonder where the time goes
(Isn't it obvious?)
(Isn't it obvious?)
So come and set the mood right underneath the moonlight

'Cause anywhere with you feel right
Anywhere with you feels like Paris in the rain, Paris in the rain
Walking down an empty street
Puddles underneath our feet"
Have You Ever Seen The Rain,Rod Stewart,"Someone told me long ago
There's a calm before the storm,
I know;
It's been comin' for some time.
When it's over, so they say,
It'll rain a sunny day,
I know;
Shinin' down like water.

[Chorus:]
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain
Comin' down on a sunny day?

Yesterday, and days before,
Sun is cold and rain is hard,
I know;
Been that way for all my time.
'Til forever, on it goes
Through the circle, fast and slow,
I know;
It can't stop, I wonder.

[Chorus]

Yeah!

Bet You Won't,Chamillionaire,"I bet you won't
I bet you won't
I bet you, I bet you, I bet you, I bet you

Man these rappers ain't saying nothing
Every verse is a damn lie
Your position is pro voice
My position is anti
Swear they tellin these stories to you
These rappers full of that mantie
Can't stop me they can try
But I'm winning up by that landslide

Y'all worse than that tie tanning
Get a ship but it won't sail
Y'all posting on snitchagram
Why you saying you don't tell
These boys they got no stamps
They don't really touch no mail
I'm still trying to get super poster
Still fill up under her oh well

All talking like he the man
Y'all softer than Peter Pan
So many fish in my fishtank
And my crib she talking about eating in
Call me up sure be to spend
Got money treating pass me your lamb
Play me hoe we won't meet again
And my knuckles probably gonna beat your chin

Get it off for my plan A
Never needed that B row
I ain't never even shed a tear
When anybody ever said peace out
Made a hit with my freestyles
They ain't talking about free now
They always told me that money talks
So I always got it on speed dial

I'm trying to work she trying to play
Treat the bank just like a hotter wave
And I'm showing up just like a holiday
But I'm back to work I'm not trying to stay
My money day is my kind of day
Very large is my kind of pay
Tell avado I'm not the best
I bet he was fond of you cayate

Wonder why I'm ahead of them
Talking down then I ended them
They try to say that they on your side
But switch back and forth just like pendulums
Bought your strap and extended 'em
New cars when they rented them
Our old schools look so cool
That you probably thought we invented them

Steal a heart but I'm not thief
Star snatching is so weak
You ain't gotta thank me for it
Just show respect to my OG
I drop it off in your OD
Veteran but I'm cold beat
They keep saying I don't drop
So might drop another in 4 weeks

Chamilitary go so beast
Freestyle on your beats
Gotta take it out of my 2 hands
And that's the reason it don't leak
2 businesses out of state
No card that's out of date
I've been stuntin on 'em since '98
If you tryin' to hate then you kinda late

Hit Brazil and take frequent trips
Groupies all on that freaky tip
Say goodnight and then take a flight
When I disappear you can't keep a chip
Let me tell you how deep it get
This is more about keeping it
Take a pocket then strippen it
Then I put the profit down deep in it

Your girl talking about orgies
Rather go get more G's
Duplicate how I rep the state
We need less of them and need more of me
Spit a verse then it's for a free
Tryin to do it before hopefully
No trick or treat in my clickazie
And I'm feeling like it's your boy D

Sip patrone while they copy
Call me up and say papi
Knowing that I might store so they tryna
Block me like we play hockey
Pocket got me like Gretzky
Where the hell is my SB
I use sandboat to that paper
Going go and tell them come catch me

Don't talk about financials
Tell me what your man do
Unless you got your own dough
And you make enough cash to brag to
Hope your rent ain't pass due
Hope your shape is natural
Can't say you're a model
Even if that shit was in your bathroom

Why everybody got to be the same
Every group got to be a game
Every rapper got to be a rapper
And every rapper got to be a lame
Love my jewelry that's cool
She gonna catch a bad flu
But if my wrist ain't sick enough
Then my whip gonna make her hat you

Everything happen for a purpose
Obvious they didn't mean your verses
Every verse that y'all spit is worthless
And they couldn't pay me to give you a purchase
Every verse they say Cham is ripping
Say it's false if they tell you different
I'm still a Jordan grand and a Pippen
Up man your scripts don't have me trippin"
when the party's over,Lewis Capaldi,"Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleeding
But nothing ever stops you leaving

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer
And I'll call you when the party's over

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

But nothing is better, sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own"

I don't see but I feel
Sour energy brought me there
Search into you and the paper's gon fill up itself
So fuck if you curse when I flex
Fuck I'm not kind and stupid, better serve me respect
I think I'm good at feeling bad
Don't be too nice when scavengers are ready to bounce
I picture plans in my head
Darker than Dinka
Venom pushing up my edges
I won't let dirt on my name
Do it for fun
'Front of me bitch you bargain
I ain't got a lot to sing
Still alive just for the hate that I hate, bitch
You gon' remember the name
Jungle ain't shit when you're beaten all over again
Smoking the shine in my eyes and I'm left with some apeshit
Enlighten but thoughts are the darkest
Wildin' everywhere but in the jungle
Come to R city we 'bout to fuck the freckles of your face
In you flaws you don't wanna, wanna
Racing against myself faster, faster
If I slow down it's the ganja, ganja
If I fuck up it's the karma, karma

No tears falling down my eyes
No fear left into my mind
All this evil turned me blind
I need to run towards the light
No tears falling down my eyes
No fear left into my mind
All this evil turned me blind
I need to run towards the light

Promise me you won't be falling
Say to me you are my greatest opponent
I keep the backbone solid
Tahia Djazaïr
Baba grew up in the sand and the mountains
Fuck what you heard if you hear what you're saying
Didn't like my song
You said ""this shit's amazing""
I'm tired of the Yes-men
I'm tired of the Yasminas
Tired of the elephantshit I see

Ouh skibidibam
Back in her pussy it has been while (while)
Ouh shaking new hands
Fucking new bitches and making new songs (muy bien)
Ouh back and I run
Feel like my libido me never done
Why you keep on running when your legs already broken?

Now I'm putting down the 'juana
Back to the hagla
Is you really? I said kinda
Pray that my sins never come back
Bypass the drama
Look ain't no blood on my contracts
And imma dance like a warrior
Salam hyenas
You cannot switch off the phoenix
This ain't no threat but my simple statement
Welcome to the jungle Rilès vs Satan

No tears falling down my eyes
No fear left into my mind
All this evil turned me blind
I need to run towards the light
No tears falling down my eyes
No fear left into my mind
All this evil turned me blind
I need to run towards the light"
Come Out And Play,Billie Eilish,"Wake up and smell the coffee
Is your cup half full or empty?
When we talk, you say it softly
But I love it when you're awfully quiet, quiet

You see a piece of paper
Could be a little greater
Show me what you could make her
You'll never know until you try it
You don't have to keep it quiet

And I know it makes you nervous
But I promise you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything you kept inside
Don't hide, don't hide
Too shy to say, but I hope you stay
Don't hide away
Come out and play

Look up, out of your window
See snow, won't let it in though
Leave home, feel the wind blow
'Cause it's colder here inside in silence
You don't have to keep it quiet

Yeah, I know it makes you nervous
But I promise you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything you kept inside
Don't hide, don't hide
Too shy to say but I hope you stay
Don't hide away
Come out and play"
Ghost,Au/Ra & Alan Walker,"Today I'm kinda feelin' like a ghost
Call my friends but ain't nobody home
Tell myself I'm fine, but I don't really know
I'm just scared that I'll end up
I'll end up, I'll end up alone

I never let it show
But I feel like a missed call on a phone
Tryna live my life pay as you go
But I'm so scared that I'll end up
I'll end up, I'll end up alone

You know I'm like a ghost
Sometimes I have to fade
And it haunts me that I have to be this way
You say it's gone cold
I say I'll do better
But I always seem to disappear again
You know I'm like a ghost
I see it in your face
And it haunts me that I have to be this way
You say it's gone cold
I say I'll do better
But I always seem to disappear again
You know I'm like a ghost...

You know I never meant to cut you off
Got phantom feelings I can never stop
Stranger things to worry 'bout I know
But I'm so scared that I'll end up
I'll end up, I'll end up alone

I can't see myself in the mirror
Does that mean I'm not really here?
I'm losin' touch with everything I know
And I'm so scared that I'll end up
I'll end up, I'll end up alone

You know I'm like a ghost
Sometimes I have to fade
And it haunts me that I have to be this way
You say it's gone cold
I say I'll do better
But I always seem to disappear again
You know I'm like a ghost
I see it in your face
And it haunts me that I have to be this way
You say it's gone cold
I say I'll do better
But I always seem to disappear again
You know I'm like a ghost

You know I'm like a ghost...
Ooh, I'll be OK
I'll be alright
I know, Ooh, I'll be OK

I'm just scared that I'll end up alone

You know I'm like a ghost
I see it in your face
And it haunts me that I have to be this way
You say it's gone cold
I say I'll do better
But I always seem to disappear again
You know I'm like a ghost"
Lily,"Alan Walker, K-391 & Emelie Hollow","Lily was a little girl
Afraid of the big, wide world
She grew up within her castle walls
Now and then she tried to run
And then on the night with the setting sun
She went in the woods away
So afraid, all alone

They warned her, don't go there
There's creatures who are hiding in the dark
Then something came creeping
It told her, don't you worry just

Follow everywhere I go
Top of all the mountains or valley low
Give you everything you've been dreaming of
Just let me in, ooh
Everything you want in gold
I'll be the magic story you've been told
And you'll be safe under my control
Just let me in, ooh
Just let me in, ooh

She knew she was hypnotized
And walking on cold thin ice
Then it broke, and she awoke again

Then she ran faster and
Start screaming, is there someone out there?
Please help me, come get me
Behind her, she can hear it say

Follow everywhere I go
Top of all the mountains or valley low
Give you everything you've been dreaming of
Just let me in, ooh
Everything you want in gold
I'll be the magic story you've been told
And you'll be safe under my control
Just let me in, ooh
Just let me in, ooh

Everything you want in gold
I'll be the magic story you've been told
And you'll be safe under my control
Just let me in, ooh

Follow everywhere I go
Top of all the mountains or valley low
Give you everything you've been dreaming of
Just let me in, ooh

Start screaming, is there someone out there?

Niggas up, she in the back of the truck
Lil' mommy wanna fuck and she really wanna suck
When I finish with it then we go in the back of the club
And we do this shit again my nigga, pronto
Bip-de-badda-de-booda-de-beat it like a bongo
Banging on the pussy like a nigga named Alonzo
Head game crazy, that make her the head honcho
Mad cause I took his bitch and now he thinks he macho?
Somebody better call the cops yo

Put him in a box so the nigga in a cargo (cargo, cargo)
Shut a nigga down (fake bitch)

10031 is where my zip is
Livin how I live up in the trenches

Run through a bodega like I ain't got (come on)
Don't do it for the haters, I do it for the bitches
My flow Al-Qaeda, I kill rap niggas
Y'all Now and Laters, sweet ass-niggas
Soon as you get famous, they wanna ass-kiss
Only thing that I'm missing is Hov verse (JAY-Z)
I get a feeling, they want the old Ferg
""Cocaine Castle"", ""Hood Pope"" Ferg
Got a question to ask, do you know Ferg?
Do you know that I come from where the toast burn?
New York, New York, I run for dirt
On Hungry Ham up on the corner
Fiends taste the lean, they never sober
For being in the streets to run a culture
I never been in the weave, I had hoes, brah
Who's that jiggy motherfucker with the clothes, brah?
I'm finna kill these motherfuckers with the flow, brah

Blackin' like I'm fresh out from retirement
My flow still monumental
Mental, couldn't ride an instrumental but they ridin' dick
I set the standard for requirements, so call the firemen
Just me, myself and I, the world is mine, I put the ""I"" in his
His posse too clean, his diamonds like tip
His skin too clear, his bitch gon' stare
So mind your biz, how they find the time for minding mine
I find these college chicks for top with Kylie's lips
Oh my, oh my (running)
Running, running like you want it (running)
Running, running like you stole it (running)
Running, running like I'm going (woo)
Running, pitching like I'm bowling (woo)

Load a semi for the chiddy bang

Hit up Remy for the pretty gang

Lately I feel like a Beatle
I'm Paulie McCartney just rocking Moschino
Moscato or Pinot
I got some bitches to hop in the Regal, phenomenal deep throat
I'm more Ali than Muhammad
My noodles was Ramen, go Google my diamonds
I got some shooters in college
I feel like a coach, I'm recruiting and signing
Look, I still be moving in silence
I'm ballin' in blue like I'm hooping in Dallas
Bitch I don't play for no Mavericks
You need to think who gon' pay for your casket
Ignorant bastard
But I'm still conscious enough to give hope to the masses
Watch the coke do gymnastics
Dominique Dawes, foreign my car when I'm mashin'

[French Montana:]
Chain busting it down, wrist busting it down
Your bitch busting it down, rap game up fucking it now
I could be a jeweler, neck on Slick the Ruler
You niggas is comedy, talking fast like Bone Thugs-N-Harmony
KRS-One, Big L flows
Son of a gun with the Buffalo
Head on my wrist is a P1
Made more money than E1
One time Chinx, two time Yams (Yams)
Get the money slide like a violin
You know my nigga Max almost home
You know we run the East Coast zone nigga

[Rick Ross:]
In the kitchen culinary, I could whip a Bloody Mary
And I wish that blood would dead me, I'ma get your brother burried
Gangbanging with your halo, business on the payphone
Bitches pussies drying up, like Taz's Angels
Never was a client, 'cause that boy ain't buying it
And I got a bottom bitch, my top come on consignment
Step up from the minor league, double M the dynasty
No I never sold dope, I just got me a finder's fee
Following my frequency, niggas rapping week to week
Suckers be so weak to me, text but don't speak to me
You can never speak for me, see the B.I. chemistry
Check into the crazy house, I'ma turn the labels out

Bottles sipping, love to burp, young nigga that's doing dirt
Long Beach across my shirt, all y'all niggas gon' get merked
What the fuck is you talking 'bout?
Me and Ferg, we gon' put in work
Bang on ya' gang culture, out of this world
It's all on a bitch, is she a Blood? Is she a Crip?
Don't slip, think not, on the block where it's hot
Legalize with the nines, give a fuck about a cop
Real shit, this is it, from the bottom to the Bay
This is anybody K, California all day
Yes-sir, on the curb, Mossberg by the band
Little homies on the roof with the blam, blam, blam!
Long Beach, popping pill on 'em

Beckons a calmness

Every doubt, every imperfection

I just wanna be here with You
I'm lost in Your mystery
I'm found in Your love for me
I just wanna be here with You

Here in the waiting
I won't worry about tomorrow
No need to focus
On the things I can't control

All my attention
On the wonder of this moment

There's nowhere I'd rather be
When You're singing over me
I just wanna be here with You
I'm lost in Your mystery
I'm found in Your love for me
I just wanna be here with You

Be consumed with who You are
All the glory of Your presence
What more could I ask for?

What happened to our sweet harmony

How to talk to you
I don't know to be there
When you need me
It feels like the only time you'll see me
Is when you turn your head
To the side and look at me differently
Ohh...
Yeah, and last night
I think I lost my patience
Last night I got high as your expectations
Last night, oh I came to realization
And I hope you could take it
I hope you could take it all

I've been faithful and I've been reckless at every bend
I've held everything together and watched it shatter
I've stood tall and I have crumbled in the same breath

I have wrestled and I have trembled toward surrender
Chased my heart adrift and drifted home again
Plundered blessing till I've been desperate to find redemption
And every time I turn around Lord You're still there

I was found before I was lost
I was Yours before I was not
Grace to spare for all my mistakes
And that part just wrecks me

And I know I
I don't deserve this kind of love
Somehow
This kind of love is who You are
It's a grace I could never add up
To be somebody You still want
Somehow
You love me as You find me

Who am I to think Your glory needs my praises
But if this borrowed breath is Yours Lord take it all
You are faithful and You are gracious and I'm just grateful
To think you don't need a single thing and still You want my heart

I was found before I was lost
I was Yours before I was not
You wear the scars
And that part just wrecks me

And I know I
I don't deserve this kind of love
Somehow
This kind of love is who You are
It's a grace I could never add up
To be somebody You still want
Somehow
You love me as You find me
You love me as You find me
You love me as You find me
You love me as You find me

Your love's too good to leave me here (You love me as You find me)
Your love's too good to leave me here (You love me as You find me)
Your love's too good to leave me here (You love me as You find me)
Your love's too good to leave me here (You love me as You find me)
Your love's too good to leave me here
If you want my heart I won't second guess
Cause I need Your love more than anything
I'm in
I'm Yours
Your love's too good to leave me here
Your love's too good to leave me here
Your love's too good

And I know I
I don't deserve this kind of love
Somehow
This kind of love is who You are
It's a grace I could never add up
To be somebody You still want
Somehow
You love me as You find me
You love me as You find me
You love me as You find me"
Hosanna,Hillsong United,"I see the King of glory
Coming on the clouds with fire
The whole earth shakes
The whole earth shakes

Yeah

I see His love and mercy
Washing over all our sin
The people sing
The people sing

[Chorus]
Hosanna
Hosanna
Hosanna in the highest [x2]

I see a generation
Rising up to take their place
With selfless faith
With selfless faith

I see a near revival
Stirring as we pray and seek
We're on our knees
We're on our knees

[Chorus]

Heal my heart and make it clean
Open up my eyes to the things unseen
Show me how to love like You have loved me

Break my heart for what breaks Yours
Everything I am for Your kingdom's cause
As I walk from earth into eternity

[Chorus x2]

Hosanna in the highest"
Whole Heart (Hold Me Now),Hillsong United,"Hold me now
In the hands that created the heavens
Find me now
Where the grace runs as deep as Your scars
You pulled me from the clay
You set me on a rock
Called me by Your Name
And made my heart whole again

Lifted up
And my knees know it's all for Your glory
I might stand
With more reasons to sing than to fear
You pulled me from the clay
Set me on a rock
Called me by Your Name
And made my heart whole again

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

Once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds me now

And that grace
Owns the ground where the grave did
Where all my shame remains
Left for dead in Your wake
You crashed those age-old gates
You left no stone unturned
You stepped out of that grave
And shouldered me all the way

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

Once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds me now

Healed and forgiven
Look where my chains are now
Death has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds that ground
And Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

Once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds me now

Healed and forgiven
Look where my chains are now
Death has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds that ground
And Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now

Healed and forgiven
Look where my chains are now
Death has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds that ground
And Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now"
99 Luftballons,Nena,"Hast du etwas Zeit für mich?
Dann singe ich ein Lied für dich
Von neunundneunzig Luftballons
Auf ihrem Weg zum Horizont
Denkst du vielleicht grad an mich?
Dann singe ich ein Lied für dich
Von neunundneunzig Luftballons
Und dass sowas von sowas kommt

Neunundneunzig Luftballons
Auf ihrem Weg zum Horizont
Hielt man für Ufos aus dem All
Darum schickte ein General
'ne Fliegerstaffel hinterher
Alarm zu geben, wenn's so wär
Dabei war'n dort am Horizont
Nur neunundneunzig Luftballons

Neunundneunzig Düsenflieger
Jeder war ein großer Krieger
Hielten sich für Captain Kirk
Das gab ein großes Feuerwerk
Die Nachbarn haben nichts gerafft
Und fühlten sich gleich angemacht
Dabei schoss man am Horizont
Auf neunundneunzig Luftballons

Neunundneunzig Kriegsminister
Streichholz und Benzinkanister
Hielten sich für schlaue Leute
Witterten schon fette Beute
Riefen: ""Krieg!"" und wollten Macht
Mann, wer hätte das gedacht
Dass es einmal so weit kommt
Wegen neunundneunzig Luftballons
Wegen neunundneunzig Luftballons
Neunundneunzig Luftballons

Neunundneunzig jahre Krieg
Ließen keinen Platz für Sieger
Kriegsminister gibt's nicht mehr
Und auch keine Düsenflieger
Heute zieh ich meine Runden
Seh die Welt in Trümmern liegen
Hab 'n Luftballon gefunden
Denk an dich und lass ihn fliegen"
Strangers Like Me,Peter Hollens,"Whatever you do, I'll do it too

I see myself as people see me
Oh, I just know there's something bigger out there

I wanna know, can you show me
I wanna know about these
Strangers like me
Tell me more, please show me
Something's familiar about these strangers like me

Every gesture, every move that she makes
Makes me feel like never before
Why do I have
This growing need to be beside her

Ooo, these emotions I never knew
Of some other world far beyond this place
Beyond the trees, above the clouds
I see before me a new horizon

I wanna know, can you show me
I wanna know about these strangers like me
Tell me more, please show me
Something's familiar about these strangers like me

Come with me now to see my world
Where there's beauty beyond your dreams
Can you feel the things I feel
Right now, with you
Take my hand
There's a world I need to know

I wanna know, can you show me
I wanna know about these strangers like me
Tell me more, please show me
Something's familiar about these strangers like me

I wanna know"

Regret,Will Reagan,"I remember back then
Back when we were friends
You knew where we were going
I knew where we'd been

But now that I am older
I feel it all, but I feel nothing
I remember then
I feel nothing, but I feel it all
I remember then
I remember then

I used to know Your matters
You used to know my sins
I met You without warning
You taught me how to bend
We walk within the borders
Of [?]
We held each other's banter
And saw the flood begin

And now that I am older
I feel it all, but I feel nothing
I remember then
I feel nothing, but I feel it all
I remember then
I remember then

I regret what I've become
Even if I live to share it
I regret what saw my eyes
When I could no longer bear it
I regret what I've become
Even if I live to share it
I regret what saw my eyes
When I could no longer bear it

I stand before You reckless
And haunted by the truth
I'm feeling like a slow hit [?]
My throat is feeling dry
And my hands are feeling numb
I couldn't see it coming
You would've seen me run

I used to know You're honest
You used to know I'm true
I used to know You woo'd me
And stayed to see me through"

Highlands (Song Of Ascent),Hillsong United,"O how high would I climb mountains
If the mountains were where You hide
O how far I'd scale the valleys
If You graced the other side

O how long have I chased rivers
From lowly seas to where they rise
Against the rush of grace descending
From the source of its supply

Cause in the highlands and the heartache
You're neither more or less inclined
I would search and stop at nothing
You're just not that hard to find

Oh I will praise You on the mountain
And I will praise you when the mountain's in my way
You're the summit where my feet are
So I will praise You in the valleys all the same
No less God within the shadows
No less faithful when the night leads me astray
Cause You're the Heaven where my heart is
In the highlands and the heartache all the same

O how far beneath Your glory
Does Your kindness extend the path
From where your feet rest on the sunrise
To where You sweep the sinner's past

And though how fast would you come running
If just to shadow me through the night
Trace my steps through all my failures
And walk me out the other side

For who could dare ascend that mountain
That valleyed hill called Calvary
But for the One I call Good Shepherd
Who like a lamb was slain for me

Oh I will praise You on the mountain
And I will praise you when the mountain's in my way
You're the summit where my feet are
So I will praise You in the valleys all the same
No less God within the shadows
No less faithful when the night leads me astray
Cause You're the Heaven where my heart is
In the highlands and the heartache all the same

Sing it out

Whatever I walk through
Wherever I am
Your Name can move mountains
Wherever I stand
And if ever I walk through
The valley of death
I'll sing through the shadows
My song of ascent

Whatever I walk through
Wherever I am
Your Name can move mountains
Wherever I stand
And if ever I walk through
The valley of death
I'll sing through the shadows
My song of ascent
My song of ascent

Sing it out

My song of ascent

From the gravest of all valleys
Come the pastures we call grace
A mighty river flowing upwards
From a deep but empty grave

So I will praise You on the mountain
And I will praise you when the mountain's in my way
You're the summit where my feet are
Yes you are
So I will praise You in the valleys all the same
No less God within the shadows
No less faithful when the night leads me astray
You're the Heaven where my heart is
In the highlands and the heartache all the same"

Stormed the gates of hell
Ripping through the veil

"Take Me Home, Country Roads",John Denver,"Almost heaven, West Virginia, Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
Life is old there, older than the trees, younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze

Country roads, take me home to the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma, take me home, country roads

All my memories gather round her, miner's lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky, misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye

Country roads, take me home to the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma, take me home, country roads

I hear her voice in the morning hour, she calls me, the radio reminds me of my home far away
And driving down the road I get a feeling that I should have been home yesterday, yesterday

Country roads, take me home to the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma, take me home, country roads

Country roads, take me home to the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma, take me home, country roads

Take me home, down country roads
Take me home, down country roads"
It's My Life,Bon Jovi,"This ain't a song for the broken-hearted
No silent prayer for the faith-departed
I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd
You're gonna hear my voice
When I shout it out loud

It's my life
It's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said,
""I did it my way.""
I just wanna live while I'm alive
It's my life

This is for the ones who stood their ground
For Tommy and Gina who never backed down
Tomorrow's getting harder make no mistake
Luck ain't even lucky
Got to make your own breaks

It's my life
And it's now or never
I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said,
""I did it my way.""
I just want to live while I'm alive
'Cause it's my life

Better stand tall when they're calling you out
Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down

It's my life
And it's now or never
'Cause I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive
(It's my life)
My heart is like an open highway
Like Frankie said,
""I did it my way.""
I just want to live while I'm alive

It's my life
And it's now or never
'Cause I ain't gonna live forever
I just want to live while I'm alive

Bohemian Rhapsody,Panic! At The Disco,"Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality

Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go
Little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away

Mama, ooh
Didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on
As if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come
Sent shivers down my spine
Body's aching all the time
Goodbye everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth

Mama, ooh
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouette of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning
Very, very frightening me
(Galileo) Galileo
(Galileo) Galileo
Galileo Figaro
Magnifico

I'm just a poor boy
Nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy
From a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity

Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go (Let him go!)
Bismillah! We will not let you go (Let him go!)
Bismillah! We will not let you go (Let me go!)
Will not let you go (Let me go!)
Never, never let you go
Never let me go, oh
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh, mama mia, mama mia (Mama mia, let me go)
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, you can't do this to me, baby
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here

(oh, yeah, oh, yeah)

Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me

Anyway the wind blows"

Square body when I fuckin' square up (Woo)
Boot scootin' buggy in my knee cap jeans
You got a gun but you're scared of me
I be on a beat and I don't even grow no tomatoes
You can't touch me like a really hot ass potato (Woo)
Walk around with my neck muscles flexed out
Pocket full of money and some goddamn rainbow trout
Fuck fishin' license I don't need that
Hit the game warden smack dab in his little gonads
I'm lit'r than a truck on fire, swervin'
Hotter than a distillery full of bourbon
Nice twenty-two by fourteens, I hope you curb 'em

Dip stains on my steerin' wheel and all my covers
Santa Clause doesn't know but Rudolf got it comin'
Last year I asked for a '58 Biscayne
All I got was an orange and a pack of ROGAINE
You give me all that coal, you ain't give me propane
Now I got beef, I'm about to steal your sleigh
I listen to country music even when I sleep
I walk it like I talk it, I got boots in my teeth
My station wagon got a Jesus fish
Cut fender wells on 40's, bitch
Big lift kit 'cause I'm closer to God
Plus he gave me a ding-dong the size of an Eddie Bauer rod
Skeet shootin' with some buddies from my hometown
Pistol packin' that kaboom when we go downtown
'Cause the weirdos on the corner look like sewer rats
Seen a dude in plaid shorts shit his pants, that's a fuckin' fact
I wasn't even high, I ain't even drink Jack
But that fella who pooped prolly coulda used a tater sack
Eww diarrhea in his Air Force 1's
If he was wearin' Tony Lamas it wouldn't have happened to him
Alright back to the cool shit, like I was sayin'
I want a mullet so long that it touches the pavement
I need a Dukes of Hazard car so I can smash all the Daisys
But like not the cousin ones, I mean like non-blood related

Bald-ass head but my nipples still hella hairy

Take it to the curb slidin' sideways (Skrrt)
Then I turn it around and I take it back to my place
Put her ass on the couch then we hit a three way, woah (Damn)

If you ain't about this country well motherfuck you
Your cousin hit me up, I nutted, cashew
Think I caught something, hold up, *ah choo*

Skinny jeans with Cope rings on you fake motherfuckers
Big shit and big rigs rather be like truckers
Lift kits and bit tits, eat a bitch like supper
I hide my face so the Clintons can't find me
Next day you'll find me suicided from a pine tree
I turn around to see what's behind me
A fat booty chick, plump lips, a dime piece (A huge bitch)
I'm here, I'm there, elf on the shelf
Got bars by the load tucked under my belt
Tongue kissin' your bitch, dick her down then she melt

Nobody Loves Me Like You,Chris Tomlin,"Morning
I see you in the sunrise every morning
It's like a picture that you've painted for me
A love letter in the sky

Story
I could've had a really different story
But you came down from heaven to restore me
Forever saved my life

Nobody loves me like you love me Jesus
I stand in awe of your amazing ways
I worship you as long as I am breathing
God you are faithful and true
Nobody loves me like you

Mountains
You're breaking down the weight of all my mountains
Even when it feels like I'm surrounded
You never leave my side

Nobody loves me like you love me Jesus
I stand in awe of your amazing ways
I worship you as long as I am breathing
God you are faithful and true

Beautiful In White,Westlife,"Not sure if you know this
But when we first met
I got so nervous I couldn't speak

In that very moment
I found the one and
My life had found its missing piece

So as long as I live I'll love you
Will have and hold you
You look so beautiful in white
And from now to my very last breath
This day I'll cherish
You look so beautiful in white
Tonight

What we have is timeless
My love is endless
And with this ring I say to the world

You're my every reason
You're all that I believe in
With all my heart I mean every word

So as long as I live I'll love you
Will have and hold you
You look so beautiful in white
And from now to my very last breath
This day I'll cherish
You look so beautiful in white
Tonight

You look so beautiful in white
So beautiful in white
Tonight

And if our daughter's what our future holds
I hope she has your eyes
Finds love like you and I did
But when she falls in love we'll let her go
I'll walk her down the aisle
She'll look so beautiful in white

You look so beautiful in white

So as long as I live I'll love you
Will have and hold you
You look so beautiful in white
And from now to my very last breath
This day I'll cherish
You look so beautiful in white
Tonight

You look so beautiful in white

Diamond Heart,Alan Walker & Sophia Somajo,"Hello, sweet grief
I know you will be the death of me
Feel like the morning after ecstasy
I am drowning in an endless sea

Hello, old friend
Here's the misery that knows no end
So I'm doing everything I can
To make sure I never love again

I wish that I did not know
Where all broken lovers go
I wish that my heart was made of stone
Yeah, if I was bulletproof
I'd love you black and blue
If I was solid like a jewel

If I had a diamond heart
Oh, oh
I'd give you all my love
If I was unbreakable
If I had a diamond heart
Oh, oh
You could shoot me with a gun of gold
If I was unbreakable

I'd walk straight through the bullet
Bend like a tulip
Blue-eyed and foolish
Never mind the bruises
Into the fire
Breakin' through the wires
Give you all I've got

(If I had a diamond heart)
I'd walk straight through the dagger
Never break the pattern
Diamonds don't shatter
Beautiful and battered
Into the poison
Cry you an ocean
Give you all I've got

Goodbye, so long
I don't know if this is right or wrong
Am I giving up where I belong?
'Cause every station is playing our song

Goodbye, my love
You are everything my dreams made of
You'll be Prince and I'm the crying dove
If I only were unbreakable

I wish that I did not know
Where all broken lovers go
I wish that my heart was made of stone
Yeah, if I was bulletproof
I'd love you black and blue
If I was solid like a jewel

If I had a diamond heart
Oh, oh
I'd give you all my love
If I was unbreakable
If I had a diamond heart
Oh, oh
You can shoot me with a gun of gold
If I was unbreakable

I'd walk straight through the bullet
Bend like a tulip
Blue-eyed and foolish
Never mind the bruises
Into the fire
Breakin' through the wires
Give you all I've got

Wish You The Best,Lecrae,"[Lecrae:]
Listen, look, I see you on IG
Your little man so big now
See you move to the west coast, and you done copped yourself a crib now
I'm sure by now you've moved on
I mean it's been some years since I left you in your bedroom wiping tears
I disappeared after I had met your momma now
And you met all my family too
They told us ""love was complicated""
We told them ""we gon' make it through""
But I blew it, I missed it, I didn't make you Mrs., I just made you misses
I didn't put no ring on yo finger, but I did put you through the ringer
Yeah, I own that
Wish I could go back
Treat you right take and take my wrongs back
And you should know that I

I wish you all the love you could imagine
And I wish you everything that never happened

[Verse Simmonds:]
I wish you luck
I wish you love
I wish you everything, everything that you ever dreamed of
I wish you life
I wish you joy
I wish you everything, everything a girl would want
I wish you the best
I know I'm the worst
You deserve the best
That's what you deserve

[Lecrae:]
Yeah, yeah, now how we get this far?
Everything escalated
Late nights talkin' on the phone
Even with my situation, I'm so taken
But either way, I called you when you hit back
And we talked through all my dark times and you told me to just kick back
Lay on your shoulders
Know we friends but we closer
Thought that this could never work but I kept on walking that road
Maybe reconsider everything
Tell my girl we'll prolly never make it to the wedding day
I might not be ready, man
Oh, left her at the altar
Pretty sure I scarred her
And I hope that Heaven called her
And I wish I never falter

And I wish her every joy she could imagine
And I wish you everything that never happened

[Verse Simmonds:]
I wish you luck
I wish you love
I wish you everything, everything that you ever dreamed of
I wish you life
I wish you joy
I wish you everything, everything a girl would want
I wish you the best
I know I'm the worst
You deserve the best
That's what you deserve

[Lecrae:]
I know, I know I'm the reason you stopped believin' in love
'Cause the man I was that left you needin' more than I could ever be then
Crazy how everything's changed
Married now, I'm in a new space
And I heard you moved upstate
Well, I wish you the best always

[Verse Simmonds:]
I wish you luck
I wish you love
I wish you everything, everything that you ever dreamed of
I wish you life
I wish you joy
I wish you everything, everything a girl would want
I wish you the best"
Outro,Majid Jordan,"But I had to throw it all away

And, I gave, I gave your love away
I said I love you, baby
And, I, I gave your love away
I said I love you, baby
And, I, I gave your love away
I said I love you

Almost quit on myself
It felt like it was over

But I had to throw it all away
I said I love you, baby
And, I, I gave your love away
I said I love you, baby
And, I gave, I gave your love away
I said I love you, baby
And, I, I gave your love away
I said I love you, baby
And, I, I gave your love away
I said I love you"

Are you listenin’?
Do what you are told or what you are told will be done to you, simple wisdom it
City sprawlin’ with soldiers on war horses
With chest armor armed forces for official employers
Roman source patrol off on the dogs roaming remorseless
‘Cause job shortage makes some rob to recoup losses
Full equipped with gods on high cliffs
Bombs from drone ships, it’s lightning from Zeus’ fist
18 A-list VIP as it gets
‘Cause pirate computer mix worth a trillion bits
2016, rulers with big dreams
One world, one Roman government, one currency
One slave populace from one goddess' ovaries
One love motherfucker and it ain’t for you or me
Totalitarian, barbarian

Meet me there..."
Runaway Train,Jamie N Commons & Skylar Grey,"Call you up in the middle of the night
Like a firefly without a light
You were there like a blowtorch burning
I was a key that could use a little turning

So tired that I couldn't even sleep
So many secrets I couldn't keep
Promised myself I wouldn't weep
One more promise I couldn't keep

It seems no one can help me now
I'm in too deep, there's no way out
This time I have really lead myself astray

Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Can you help me remember how to smile?
Make it somehow all seem worthwhile
How on earth did I get so jaded?
Life's mysteries seem so faded

I can go where no one else can go
I know what no one else knows
Here I am, just drowning in the rain
With a ticket for a runaway train

Everything seems cut and dry
Day and night, earth and sky
Somehow I just don't believe it

Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

(Somehow I'm neither here nor there)

Bought a ticket for a runaway train
Like a madman laughing at the rain
A little out of touch, a little insane
It's just easier than dealing with the pain

Runaway train never going back
Wrong way on a one-way track
Seems like I should be getting somewhere
Somehow I'm neither here nor there

Runaway train never coming back
Runaway train tearing up the track
Runaway train burning in my veins
I run away but it always seems the same"
The Gambler,Johnny Cash,"About twenty years ago
On a train bound for nowhere
I met up with The Gambler
We were both too tired to sleep
So we took turns a starin'
Through the window at the darkness
'Til boredom overtook us
And he commenced to speak

He said, 'Son, I've made a life
Out of readin' people's faces
And knowin' what their cards were
By the way they held their eyes
And if you don't mind my sayin'
I would say you're out of aces
And for one taste of your whiskey
I will give you some advice'

So I handed him my bottle
And he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette
Then he bummed a light
The night got deathly quiet
And his face lost all expression
He said, 'If you're gonna play the game, boy
You better learn to play it right'

'Cause ev'ry gambler knows
That the secret to survival
Is knowin' what to throw away
And knowin' what to keep
And ev'ry hand's a winner
Just like ev'ry hand's a loser
And the best that you can hope for
Is to die in your sleep.

You got to know when to hold 'em
Know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away
Know when to run
You don't ever count your money
While you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin'
When the dealin' is done

You got to know when to hold 'em
Know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away
Know when to run
You don't ever count your money
While you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin'
When the dealin' is done

And when he finished speakin'
He turned back t'ward the window
Put out his cigarette
Faded off to sleep
And somewhere in the darkness
The gambler he broke even
But in his final words
I found an ace that I could keep

You got to know when to hold 'em
Know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away
Know when to run
You don't ever count your money
While you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin'
When the dealin' is done

You got to know when to hold 'em
Know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away
Know when to run
You don't ever count your money
While you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin'
When the dealin' is done

You got to know when to hold 'em
Know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away
Know when to run
You don't ever count your money
While you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin'

And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I'm lovin'
We're just tryna figure everything out

We don't fit in well
'Cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help
Gettin' out of this conversation, yeah

You look stunning, dear
So don't ask that question here
This is my only fear, that we become
Beautiful people

Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
""What d'you do?"" and ""Who d'you know?""
Inside the world of beautiful people

Champagne and rolled-up notes
Prenups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party

That's not who we are
(We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful

Yeah, that's not who we are
(We are, we are, we are)
We are not beautiful

L.A. (mmm) drove for hours last night
And we made it nowhere (nowhere, nowhere)
I see stars in your eyes
When we're halfway there (we're there)

I'm not fazed by all them lights
And flashin' cameras
'Cause with my arms around you
There's no need to care

We don't fit in well
'Cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help
Gettin' out of this conversation, yeah

You look stunning, dear
So don't ask that question here
This is my only fear

Guiltless,Dodie Clark,"There is a wall in my life built by you (Mmm)
You opened a door that a kid shouldn't walk through
Oh, but I'm not bitter, I'm just tired
No use getting angry at the way that you're wired
Ignorant trauma in one afternoon

And I could never let you know (Ooh you'd never get it)
And now I'm the one who can't let go (Ooh don't say it's genetic)

I'll never know why you favour that tone (Mmm)
Not one shred of hope so I built up my own
Oh, but I'm not bitter, I'm just tired
No use getting angry at the way that you're wired
A dark politician will end up alone

And I could never let you know (Ooh you'd never get it)
And now I'm the one who can't let go (Ooh don't say it's genetic)

Monster,Dodie,"Tell me again about how it hurts
Being awfully loud for an introvert
Get out of my room
Smile wiped clean
Isn't it weird to be so mean?

I'm guessing that I've grown horns
I guess I'm human no more
I can tell I've rotted in your brain
Oh, how easily passion twists
You think I'm a crazy bitch
I craft my words to fit your head
'Cause no one listens to the dead

So maybe I will talk to you
The only way I know how to
Mmm, mmm, I've said my speech
Mmm, mmm, through sharpened teeth
You break the rules and spikes grow from your skin
Please let the devil in

A meter apart
You blankly stare
We shout in our heads
Are you still in there?
Well this ends bad, then
We knew it would
So we won't eat our words
'Cause they don't taste good

I'm guessing that I've grown horns
I guess I'm human no more
I can tell I've rotted in your brain
Oh, how easily passion twists
You think I'm a crazy bitch
A thousand words are left unsaid
'Cause no one listens to the dead

So maybe I will talk to you
The only way I know how to
Mmm, mmm, I've said my speech
Mmm, mmm, through sharpened teeth
You break the rules and spikes grow from your skin

I think it might be worth a try
Oh
Am I ready to let this die?
Mmm, mmm, a monster's here
Mmm, mmm, you plug your ears
But hey, you might just listen to it sing
Please let the devil in

(We won't eat our words / They don't taste so good)
(You've said your speech through sharpened teeth)

Look, I know that I've seen this before
High and mighty, at the top of your list
Adoring every move, now my rank is sinking
But we're both guilty of black or white thinking
And through my red eyes, you look pale
All of your scars are looking more like scales
Two ugly creatures, two sinister preachers
Blind to the past, like a couple of monsters;
Just a couple of monsters!

So maybe I will talk to you
The only way I know how to
Mmm, mmm, you've said your speech
Mmm, mmm, through sharpened teeth
You break the rules and spikes grow from your skin

Oh
I think it might be worth a try
Oh
Am I ready to let this die?
Mmm, mmm, a monster's here
Mmm, mmm, you plug your ears

You're a sunflower, I think your love would be too much
Or you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya

[Nicky Jam:]
Yo no sé lo que tú tienes
Como hace' lo que quiera' con mi vida, tú te vas y luego vienes
Yo no sé que tiene' tú, pero a la ve' yo pienso que no me convienes
A veces trato de buscar una salida, rápido tú me detienes
Así de loco tú me quieres
Pero soy un loco por ti
Tú no sabe' lo que por dentro yo siento por ti
Y por má' que no quiero verte, vuelvo a repetir
Y sentir cada parte de tu cuerpo cuando estas aquí
No te puedo mentir

Siempre estoy buscándote, yeah-yey
Trato de alejarme y tú acercándote, yeah-yey
De lo que nos pasa siempre culpándote, yeah-yey
Pero se me olvida cuando te veo desnudándote

Ese día que te conocí
No sabia que iba a ser así
El girasol más lindo del jardín
Y verte en el amanecer
Con un beso volví a caer
Dime a dónde se fue, a dónde se fue
Y ahora me quedo con la confusión
Con sentimientos de amor y dolor
Te juro que esa no fue mi intención
La flor de antes cambió de color
Uh-uh-uh-uuh
En mi vida sólo existes tú
Baby, tell what we try to proof
Si tú sabes que yo soy tu luz

And you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, es que tu amor es just too much
Or you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, you're the sunflower"
Dancing With A Stranger,Megan Nicole,"I don't wanna be alone tonight
It's pretty clear that I'm not over you
I'm still thinking 'bout the things you do
So I don't want to be alone tonight, alone tonight, alone tonight
Can you light the fire?
I need somebody who can take control
I know exactly what I need to do
'Cause I don't wanna be alone tonight, alone tonight, alone tonight

Bed Of Lies,Nicki Minaj,"[Skylar Grey:]
Do you ever think of me when you lie
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies?
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies?

[Nicki Minaj:]
You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud, but I'm 'a remain icon-stat
Balenciaga's on my boots with the python strap
You was caught up in the rush, and you was caught up in the thrill of it
You was with me way before I hit a quarter mil' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, man you got me poppin' pills in it
I told baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin'
'Cause I was doing it for us, I told 'em fuck the public
Couldn't believe that I was home alone contemplating
Overdosin', no more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked all along
I'm 'a ask on the song

[Skylar Grey:]
Do you ever think of me when you lie
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies?
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies?

[Nicki Minaj:]
I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears roll down it's like you ain't even notice em
If you had a heart, I was hoping that you would show it some
What the fuck you really telling me, what you telling me
I could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony
This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked all along
I'm 'a ask on the song

[Skylar Grey:]
So does she know I've been in that bed before
A thousand count, and not a single thread of truth
If I was just another girl
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you
There's one thing I need to know
So call me, when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself

[Skylar Grey:]
Do you ever think of me when you lie
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies?
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies?"
Second & Sebring,Of Mice & Men,"I believe it's time for me
To be famous and out of place.
I believe it's time for me
To move forward when I break through.
When I break through.
When I break through.
When I break through.

This time I'll make you,
Proud to see me over come on day light.
Proud of, who you raised.
Your shelter, your peacefulness.

So this time I'll make you proud.

Proud of, who you raised up.
You know that I will,
Always be here 'til the end.

Come back so I can say thank you for this,
Home cooked meals and a place to rest

My troubled head when you're away,
I've passed the test, I've earned an A,
Not just in school, but in life,
You'll always be right by my side.
To help me show, hope to all,
That are lost and sick in this dying world.
I'll use the love you left behind,
I'll change their minds, I'll change their minds.

I hope,
I hope you smile,
When you look down on me.
I hope you smile.

This can't, we won't know.
I hope that I make you proud.

This is not what it is, only baby scars. (These baby scars)
I need your love like a boy needs his mother's side. (I need your side)
This is not what it is, only baby scars.
I need your love like a boy needs his mother's side.

This is not what it is, only baby scars.
I need your love like a boy needs his mother's side, yeah."
The American Nightmare,Ice Nine Kills,"""Getting ready for bed at a regular time is one of the most important habits you can learn. David has probably never stopped to think what a wonderful thing sleep is. Dreams are normal too. Going to bed at a regular time each night makes it easier for you to go right off to sleep.""

Rest your head, here's a lullaby
A melody for heavy eyes
Early to bed, early to die
Welcome to your worst nightmare

Fast asleep, it's all in your head now
Past the street where they cursed my name
But I won't be forsaken
Craven my revenge from the shallow
Grave, where I went down in flames
The beast has been awakened

When night comes creeping
My cruel hand will rock you to sleep

I'm the American nightmare with American dreams
Of counting the bodies while you count sheep
I'm the American nightmare, yeah I'm living the dream
I'm slashing my way through the golden age of the silver scream
(Sweet dreams)

Fell in love with hate cause evil fit like a glove
It's fate that I'm still here
And I won't be forsaken
Wicked when I was just a man
But sickening now and fed by fear
The beast has been awakened now

They all think it's just pretend
You'll never ever sleep again
All your friends are fucking dead
You can't turn down your own death bed

When night comes creeping
My cruel hand will rock you to sleep

I'm the American nightmare with American dreams
Of counting the bodies while you count sheep
I'm the American nightmare, yeah I'm living the dream
I'm slashing my way through the golden age of the silver scream

I'm the American nightmare, I'm the man of your dreams
Where the glove is god, so I'm sinking my claws in the silver scream

One, two, dreams do come true
Three, four, see you at the morgue
Five, six, he'll get his fix
Seven, eight, now shake the twisted hand of fate
Now
Shake the twisted hand of fate
All your friends are fucking dead

When night comes creeping
My cruel hand will rock you to sleep

I'm the American nightmare with American dreams
Of counting the bodies while you count sheep
I'm the American nightmare, yeah I'm living the dream
I'm slashing my way through the golden age of the silver scream

I'm the American nightmare, I'm the man of your dreams
Where the glove is god, so I'm sinking my claws in the silver scream"
The Robot With Human Hair Pt. 2,Dance Gavin Dance,"Said it's the coming of man
And I forget when you went away
Like a kick to the face
Not winning the race
(Lion, I've seen you from afar)
I've seen her in the car
Knowing that you deserve such more
Deserved to know you're free

Leave, I'm the director
Agree to the role of the pilot inspector
Breathe, pilot inspector
Feed off the role of the radar detector
Leave, I'm the director
Agree to the role of the pilot inspector
Breathe, pilot inspector
Feed off the role of the radar detector

Well, then, you said you could do this on your own
I'm sorry baby, I can't aid you
(And then you say, hands down, right now, I'll let this go)
You...
Well, now it's up to god to save you

Save you from all of those bruised,
bruised and battered wounds
(Wave right with a gun in his hand wave right)
Can you taste this blood
Dripping sweeter than...?
And over your eyes
And I, and I fall to both knees
Not to beg for your forgiveness
But to hate the word
And you speak

Take a right off these cliffs
The ground is staring at your wounded weapons
Wounded weapons
(And I can't believe that you're right)
You can bank the night on this its round
And glaring at your well
I get hyphy
Tell 'em I get hyphy

And this is where it ends

Well, then, you said you could do this on your own
I'm sorry baby, I can't aid you
(And then you say, hands down, right now, I'll let this go)
You...
Well, now it's up to god to save you

Save you, save you
Save you, save you

I can't believe these long words
Come from many national absurd
This is a line cut across
Hope, defeat, the line, the loss
I can never be this lone wolf
You can never see me across this earth
This will be a light that I run from
You thought you were so strong
You pleaded to never be wrong

(Brace yourself, fasten belts)
Well, now that you go
(Close the hatch, flip the latch)
I sit here and wonder
(They're not dead, speed ahead)
Times have changed
It's like we've been trashing silos
(Well, now that you go)
In the time bomb aisle
(I sit here and wonder)
Maybe they'll dodge the spill
Oil kills, sure it will

And I can't breathe the air
(Hide your daughter 'cause I'm coming over)
To reach for this light
(You know I'm not lying about)
(Trashing silos in the time bomb aisle)
And you can't breathe the air
(About trashing silos in the time bomb aisle)
Not leaving her to reach
The line, the work, the rope, the love

And I have seen such worse for you

It's a no, I'm not coming back
It's a no, I'm not coming back
It's a no, I'm not coming back

And now you see the sky has turned black
Why do think everyone has turned back?
It's cause he's gone

And now you see the sky has turned black
Why do think everyone has turned back?
It's cause he's gone

And now you see the sky has turned black
Why do think everyone has turned back?
It's cause he's gone"
As You Find Me,Hillsong United,"I've been strong and I've been broken within a moment
I've been faithful and I've been reckless at every bend
I've held everything together and watched it shatter
I've stood tall and I have crumbled in the same breath

I have wrestled and I have trembled toward surrender
Chased my heart adrift and drifted home again
Plundered blessing till I've been desperate to find redemption
And every time I turn around Lord You're still there

I was found before I was lost
I was Yours before I was not
Grace to spare for all my mistakes
And that part just wrecks me

And I know I
I don't deserve this kind of love
Somehow
This kind of love is who You are
It's a grace I could never add up
To be somebody You still want
Somehow
You love me as You find me

Who am I to think Your glory needs my praises
But if this borrowed breath is Yours Lord take it all
You are faithful and You are gracious and I'm just grateful
To think you don't need a single thing and still You want my heart

I was found before I was lost
I was Yours before I was not
You wear the scars
And that part just wrecks me

And I know I
I don't deserve this kind of love
Somehow
This kind of love is who You are
It's a grace I could never add up
To be somebody You still want
Somehow
You love me as You find me
You love me as You find me
You love me as You find me
You love me as You find me

Your love's too good to leave me here (You love me as You find me)
Your love's too good to leave me here (You love me as You find me)
Your love's too good to leave me here (You love me as You find me)
Your love's too good to leave me here (You love me as You find me)
Your love's too good to leave me here
If you want my heart I won't second guess
Cause I need Your love more than anything
I'm in
I'm Yours
Your love's too good to leave me here
Your love's too good to leave me here
Your love's too good

And I know I
I don't deserve this kind of love
Somehow
This kind of love is who You are
It's a grace I could never add up
To be somebody You still want
Somehow
You love me as You find me
You love me as You find me
You love me as You find me"
Whole Heart (Hold Me Now),Hillsong United,"Hold me now
In the hands that created the heavens
Find me now
Where the grace runs as deep as Your scars
You pulled me from the clay
You set me on a rock
Called me by Your Name
And made my heart whole again

Lifted up
And my knees know it's all for Your glory
I might stand
With more reasons to sing than to fear
You pulled me from the clay
Set me on a rock
Called me by Your Name
And made my heart whole again

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

Once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds me now

And that grace
Owns the ground where the grave did
Where all my shame remains
Left for dead in Your wake
You crashed those age-old gates
You left no stone unturned
You stepped out of that grave
And shouldered me all the way

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

Once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds me now

Healed and forgiven
Look where my chains are now
Death has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds that ground
And Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

Once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds me now

Healed and forgiven
Look where my chains are now
Death has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds that ground
And Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now

Healed and forgiven
Look where my chains are now
Death has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds that ground

Bury A Friend,NateWantsToBattle,"What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me

Step on the glass, staple your tongue (ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna... end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna...

What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (wow)
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now

For the debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful

Step on the glass, staple your tongue (ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna... end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna...

What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?"

I'm not myself lately I'm foolish, I don't do this
I've been playing myself, baby I don't care
Baby your love's got the best of me
Your love's got the best of me
Baby your love's got the best of me
Baby you're making a fool of me
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees
Cause baby you got me, you got me, oh you got me, you got me

I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two or three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
And I still don't understand
Just how your love could do what no one else can

Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (your love)

Hoping you'll save me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now (your love)
Looking so crazy in love
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now

Got me hoping you'll save me right now

I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me),Fall Out Boy,"Clocks strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away
I've done alright up 'til now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls
My loneliness calls

Oh! I wanna dance with somebody
I want to feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh! I wanna dance with somebody
I want to feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me, yeah

I've been in love and lost my senses
Spinning through the town
Sooner or later the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down
I need a one who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

Oh! I wanna dance with somebody
I want to feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh! I wanna dance with somebody
I want to feel the heat...
Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Somebody, somebody
Somebody who loves me
Somebody who, somebody who
To hold me in her arms
I need a one who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My loneliness calls

Oh! I wanna dance with somebody
I want to feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh! I wanna dance with somebody
I want to feel the heat...
Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Don't you wanna dance
Dance! With me baby
Don't you wanna dance
Dance! With me now

Always Remember Us This Way (Arizona Sky) (Acoustic),Tyler Ward,"That Arizona sky
Burnin' in your eyes
You look at me and babe I wanna catch on fire
It's buried in my soul
Like California gold
You found the light in me that I couldn't find

So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
And every time we say goodbye, baby it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

Lovers in the night
Poets tryin' to write
We don't know how to rhyme but damn we'll try
But all I really know
You're where I wanna go
The part of me that's you will never die

So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye baby it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

Yeah when the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way"

Tryna talk, but we can't hear ourselves
Read your lips, I'd rather kiss 'em right back

But I'm told it's where I'm s'posed to be
You know what? It's kinda crazy 'cause I really don't mind

Lay Me Down,Sam Smith,"Yes, I do, I believe
That one day I will be
Where I was right there
Right next to you

And it's hard
The days just seem so dark
The moon and the stars
Are nothing without you

Your touch, your skin
Where do I begin?
No words can explain
The way I'm missing you

Deny this emptiness
This hole that I'm inside
These tears
They tell their own story

Told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

Can I lay by your side?
Next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call?
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy

[This verse is only in the album version:]
You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

Can I lay by your side?
Next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

Lay me down tonight
Lay me by your side
Lay me down tonight
Lay me by your side
Can I lay by your side?
Next to you
You"
Make It To Me,Sam Smith,"My mind runs away to you
With a thought I'd hope you'll see
Can't see where it's wandered to
But I know where it wants to be

I'm waiting patiently though time is moving slow
I have one vacancy and I wanted you to know that

You're the one designed for me
A distant stranger that I will complete
I know you're out there, we're meant to be
So keep your head up and make it to me
And make it to me

So sick of this lonely air
It seems such a waste of breath
So much that I need to share
So much to get off my chest

I'm waiting patiently though time is moving slow
I have one vacancy and I wanted you to know that

You're the one designed for me
A distant stranger that I will complete
I know you're out there, we're meant to be
So keep your head up and make it to me
Make it to me
Make it to me
Make it to me"
If You Could See Me Now,The Script,"(Oh if you could see me now)

(Oh if you could see me now)

It was February 14 Valentine's Day
The roses came but they took you away
Tattooed on my arm is a charm to disarm all the harm
Gotta keep myself calm but the truth is you're gone
And I'll never get to show you these songs
Dad you should see the tours that I'm on
I see you standing there next to Mom
Both singing along, yeah arm in arm
Now there are days when I'm losing my faith
Because the man wasn't good he was great
He'd say ""Music was the home for your pain""
And explain I was young, he would say,
""Take that rage, put it on a page.
Take the page to the stage.
Blow the roof off the place.""
I'm trying to make you proud
Do everything you did
I hope you're up there with God saying, ""That's my kid!""

[Chorus:]
I still look for your face in the crowd
Oh if you could see me now (Oh if you could see me now)
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow?
Oh if you could see me now (Oh if you could see me now)

(Oh if you could see me now)

If you could see me now would you recognize me?
Would you pat me on the back or would you criticize me?
Would you follow every line on my tear-stained face
Put your hand on a heart that was cold
As the day you were taken away?
I know it's been a while but I can see you clear as day
Right now, I wish I could hear you say
I drink too much, and I smoke too much dutch
But if you can't see me now that shit's a must
You used to say I won't know a win until it cost me
Like I won't know real love 'til I've loved and I've lost it
So if you've lost a sister, someone's lost a mom
And if you've lost a dad then someone's lost a son
And they're all missing out, yeah they're all missing out
So if you get a second to look down on me now
Mom, Dad I'm just missing you now

I still look for your face in the crowd
Oh if you could see me now (Oh if you could see me now)
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow?
Oh if you could see me now (Oh if you could see me now)

Oh, oh
Would you call me a saint or a sinner?
Would you love me a loser or winner?
Oh, oh
When I see my face in the mirror
We look so alike that it makes me shiver

I still look for your face in the crowd
Oh if you could see me now (Oh if you could see me now)
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow?
Oh if you could see me now (Oh if you could see me now)
Yeah I'm just missing you now

I still look for your face in the crowd
Oh if you could see me now (Oh if you could see me now)
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow?
Oh if you could see me now (Oh if you could see me now)

You could see, you could see me now [2x]"
Sweet Hurricane,Phum Viphurit,"I was sailing alone
You came along
I'm singing the song you wrote
You led the way
I couldn't say
Words became lumps in my throat

I, I'm loving this sweet hurricane
In time, I know we'll meet once again

When you're alone
It's with you, I belong

Stories we told
Will never get old
Though the fire's gone cold, you're my flame

I, I'm loving this sweet hurricane
In time, I know we'll meet once again"
Whole Heart (Hold Me Now),Hillsong United,"Hold me now
In the hands that created the heavens
Find me now
Where the grace runs as deep as Your scars
You pulled me from the clay
You set me on a rock
Called me by Your Name
And made my heart whole again

Lifted up
And my knees know it's all for Your glory
I might stand
With more reasons to sing than to fear
You pulled me from the clay
Set me on a rock
Called me by Your Name
And made my heart whole again

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

Once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds me now

And that grace
Owns the ground where the grave did
Where all my shame remains
Left for dead in Your wake
You crashed those age-old gates
You left no stone unturned
You stepped out of that grave
And shouldered me all the way

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

Once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds me now

Healed and forgiven
Look where my chains are now
Death has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds that ground
And Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

Once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds me now

Healed and forgiven
Look where my chains are now
Death has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds that ground
And Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now

Healed and forgiven
Look where my chains are now
Death has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds that ground
And Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now"

Nervous,Gavin James,"I promise that I'll hold you when it's cold out
When we lose our winter coats in the spring
Cause lately I was thinking I never told you
That every time I see you my heart sings

Cause we lived at the carnival in summer
We scared ourselves to death on a ghost train
And just like every ferris wheel stops turning
Oh I guess we had an expiration date
So I won't say I love you, it's too late

And oooooooooh
Ooooohohoooooh
And oooohoooooooh
Ohoooohohohoooooh

Cause every time I saw you I got nervous
Shivering and shaking at the knees
And just like every song I haven't heard yet no
I didn't know the words in front of me
In front of me, and oooooooh
But I don't wanna know

Who'll take you home?
Who'll take you home?
Who'll take you home?
Hoooooome
If I let you gooooooooooo

And oooooohhhhh
And oooooohhhhh
And oooooohhhhh
Oooooooohooooohoohhhh

Now that you're on someone else's shoulders
The winter winds are colder on my own
Maybe we will meet when we get older
Maybe we won't
So I won't say I love you if you don't
And no you don't
So I won't say I love you if you don't"

You caught me by surprise

When I met those hazel eyes

Woah...
Oh what a shame, we are parting ways
In a time set for us two
But if you should ask me
Do I adore you?

Heart full of hate, no vacancy
Only one you gonna to blame when it's over
Can't look me in my eyes when you sober
Hey, I'm the one you call when you feel alone
Running up a check just to help you cope
I just want to live in the moment
You just want to fight cause you lonely
Tryna see a milly then be really up
Rockstar crash in my Bentley truck
You need all my love
You've got all the love

He took my sin
And He buried it

That saved my soul
All else is loss

The grip of fear
Has no hold on me

Where is your sting

Let's have a toast to the good life
Suicide before you see this tear fall down my eyes
Me and my baby, we gon' be alright
We gon' live a good life
Big homie better grow up
Me and my whoadies 'bout to stroll up
I see them boppers in the corner
They sneaking out the back door
He only want me when I'm not there
He better call Becky with the good hair
He better call Becky with the good hair"

You got me looking, so crazy my baby
I'm not myself lately I'm foolish, I don't do this
I've been playing myself, baby I don't care
Baby your love's got the best of me
Your love's got the best of me
Baby your love's got the best of me
Baby you're making a fool of me
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees
Cause baby you got me, you got me, oh you got me, you got me

I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two or three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
And I still don't understand
Just how your love could do what no one else can

Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (your love)

Hoping you'll save me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now (your love)
Looking so crazy in love
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now

Got me hoping you'll save me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now (your love)

Bow Down (Homecoming Live),Beyonce,"Coachella
Thank ya'll so much for having us once again
I'm so honored to be on this stage tonight
And this next song is for all of my queens
Do we have any beautiful queens in the house tonight?
I want you to sing along if you know the lyrics
It's called Bow Down

I know when you were little girls
You dreamt of being in my world
Don't forget it, don't forget it
Respect that, bow down bitches
I took some time to live my life
But don't think I'm just his little wife
Don't get it twisted, get it twisted
This my shit, bow down bitches

Bow down, bow bow bow down
Bow down, bow bow bow down
Bow down, bow bow bow down
I'm so crown, bow bow bow down

With You (Paradoxology),Elevation Worship,"Beneath the surface
Of my anxious imagination
Beckons a calmness
That is found in You alone

It washes over
Every doubt, every imperfection
Jesus, Your presence
Is the comfort of my soul

There's nowhere I'd rather be
When You're singing over me
I just wanna be here with You
I'm lost in Your mystery
I'm found in Your love for me
I just wanna be here with You

Here in the waiting
I won't worry about tomorrow
No need to focus
On the things I can't control

All my attention
On the wonder of this moment
Jesus, your presence
Is the comfort of my soul

There's nowhere I'd rather be
When You're singing over me
I just wanna be here with You
I'm lost in Your mystery
I'm found in Your love for me
I just wanna be here with You

So let all that I am
Be consumed with who You are
All the glory of Your presence
What more could I ask for?

In Love With You,Chris Tomlin,"I feel like singing now
My heart is free

You've forgiven me
Your name's the sweetest sound to my ears,
Lord hold me near

I'm in love, love with You
Like I never dreamed
I'm in love, love with You
And I'm flying free
From the things that tie me down
I'm walking on the ground
I'm in love, love with You

You're all I think about
Day and night all the time
How you make my world

Go 'round and make it stop
You're all I got"
Whole Heart (Hold Me Now),Hillsong United,"Hold me now
In the hands that created the heavens
Find me now
Where the grace runs as deep as Your scars
You pulled me from the clay
You set me on a rock
Called me by Your Name
And made my heart whole again

Lifted up
And my knees know it's all for Your glory
I might stand
With more reasons to sing than to fear
You pulled me from the clay
Set me on a rock
Called me by Your Name
And made my heart whole again

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

Once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds me now

And that grace
Owns the ground where the grave did
Where all my shame remains
Left for dead in Your wake
You crashed those age-old gates
You left no stone unturned
You stepped out of that grave
And shouldered me all the way

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

Once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds me now

Healed and forgiven
Look where my chains are now
Death has no hold on me

Okie dokie, alkie, keep it lowkey like Thor lil bro
Or he'll go blow the loudy, saudy of sour Saudi
Wiley up off peyote, wilding like that coyote
If I sip any Henny, my belly just might be outie
Pull up inside a huggy, Starsky & Hutch a dougie
I just opened up the pack in an hour I'll ash my lucky
She just yelling ""fuck me""
Two weeks she'll be yelling fuck me
Tonight she just yelling ""fuck me""
Two weeks she'll be yelling fuck me
Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuckie
And Chuck E. Cheese's pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me

Jesus got me feeling like Colin Powell, all praise to the God
God knows he's a pro, he's a pro like COINTEL
Check, check mate, check me take me to the bedroom
Let me know me well, I mean normally
You see Norma Jean wouldn't kick it with Farmer Phil
But these kids these days, they get so high
Burn trees, smoke chlorophyll, 'til they can't feel

Got me feeling like Lauryn Hill, miseducated, my dick delegated
Rap Bill Bellamy, they said I shoulda never made it
Probably been dead or in jail
Deadbeat dad, enough of that jazz
Asshole, absinthe up in that glass
Are we there yet? Ice cubes in a bong
Rip, brain dead, take a tug then pass
Then pass

Best Years Of Our Lives,Baha Men,"I get such a thrill when you look in my eyes
My heart skips a beat girl I feel so alive
Please tell me baby if all this is true
Cause deep down inside all I wanted is you

Oh, makes me wanna dance
Oh, it's a new romance
Oh, I look into your eyes
Oh, best years of our lives

When we first met I could hardly believe
The things that would happen and we could achieve
So let's be together for all of our time
Oh girl I'm so thankful that you are still mine

Oh, makes me wanna dance
Oh, it's a new romance
Oh, I look into your eyes
Oh, best years of our lives

My world's a better place cause I know your mine
This love is so real and it's no surprise
Cause through the years I'll be right by your side

Oh, makes me wanna dance
Oh, it's a new romance
Oh, I look into your eyes
Oh, best years of our lives

So you always consider me an ugly duckling
Treat me like a Nostradamus
of which is why I have to keep my shine on
And break a little something to get my mind on
Cause you have my mind on
Turn the lights on,
Come on baby listen to the words of this song
Cause all I wanna do is make the rest years the best years
All night long
Oh, makes me wanna dance
Oh, it's a new romance
Oh, I look into your eyes
Oh, best years of our lives
Oh, makes me wanna dance
Oh, it's a new romance
Oh, I look into your eyes
Oh, best years of our lives"

Cruise Control,Sol,"We be coolin' in the shade
(Right)

You should try to respect
The way I mic check
When I'm rhyming on the shit
Put the lighter to the spliff
Life is just a [?], but it matters how you treat her
Love her fuck her cut and leave her
I need a lover who could be with me forever
Even if I never eat her I'm too hungry for these beats yo
I need more dough cause cash rule the globe
And if you didn't know now you know (now you know)

I put my hands up, not for the local hip hop
But to the ozone hoping I could find the gods
Climbing to the top got me shining by the brow
Sweat means you're working hard enough to feel the crowd
Feel me now, hear me now
I am really who I say I am
Your biggest fan [?] and I'm not [?]
And you're not Eminem this is hip hop
B-bop, Jazz R&B, Rock n Roll black music

I found a way to control
Where I go

I used to fly so high, I thought I'd never come down
'Til one day I found out what it's really 'bout
If you don't do it now it will never happen
I used to think I was forever rappin' til I met a 'has-been'
You lose some magic every time you use it
So don't abuse it or you'll end up as a one-hit poof-then
Who's him? No one knows
Used to blaze flows, from the back of his throat but it's been years since we've seen him glow
Do you need the needle or do you fiend for the wax
Me, I bleed on tracks, Sol, be a junkie for rap
Fuck that other shit, never touch nothin' but the pen
'Til the end, and if you see me again, my friend
Know that nothin' ever changes but the weather and the trends
And even them, they really mean nothing in the end
What was it that I said before? Oh
I found a way to control, if it's soul let me flow like

I found a way to control
Where I go

See, no matter how high, I always find a way to ride... na'mean?

Yeah... yeah...
Piano mane

It's like I only got a few more years to live
Because the window in this game is small and it closes quick
And on top of that I swear to God everybody raps
But only a chosen few support the local cats
They cut my lights out last week I'm working like a factory
A thousand CD's at a time I'm in these streets
Begging for ears to hear my blood sweat and tears
Took a couple years but in a second they dismiss
Even when I flow sick ""Sol's this
What did you expect? The same kid?"" Na I'm grown and shit
And I'm better than ya'll now
I'm fed up with ya'll now
I'm goin to get my cheddar get the fuck up or stand down
Tryna find a way to bring the corners from all around
Hold together singing the same song and sing it loud
Feel the sound from underground
Harriet Tubman style
Quit fuckin' around this is more than just a town
Let's make this money now
Control the market now
Marcus Garvey style fuck the A and R on top will knock em down
Search his pockets take my scrilla back
Cause foreala we all killas when it come to the cash

Lowkey,NIKI,"Wonder what I'll do

And the whiskey's run out

Wanna take this downtown
This liquid courage
Got me way too honest
Put your phone on vibrate
Let's catch a vibe babe
While the sun's down

Hush now, I know
We're a little too fucked up to stay still love
Be as quiet as you can
'Cause if anyone sees they'll just blow shit up
I don't gotta know if you're taken
I'll just let you know, bedroom's vacant
No one's gotta know, just us and the moon
Till the sun starts waking

Up's the only direction I see

Wizard with words, tellin' me
My energy's so bewitching
So I'll go first
There's an open bar
Let's close this distance
Oh-oh-oh, my
Don't make me have to spell it all night

I don't really give a fuck
'Bout all the ""he said, she said"" bullshit
So pick your poison love
Let's go somewhere a little more exclusive
Take a shot, take a chance, take my hand boy
Tension so intense like an asteroid
Be discreet, gotta dodge all the tabloids

Let's not think too much, there ain't no problems
As long as we keep this

Low, low, low, low, low, low, low, lowkey

Next to me is definitely no one, I'm one of one
And I musta won that from anybody who had it, or better yet forgot it
Mack in the back of a 'Lac, with a mac in the back of the 'Lac
With a latch on the back of the trunk
Hit a punk in the back with a pump, in the back, 'till he's off balance

And I'm in the back in the back of the block with a cop, wanna cop anybody's allowance
Iraq on the block, he watch for the block or whatever
And cut, no cut, more guns, more guts, fuck boy, you fucked up twice, you fuck, consider you drownin'

To thanking God I'm in a whole 'nother tax bracket

I was on the verge of breaking down
(Oh, just slip the noose, untie the rope from my wrists)
I was on the verge of breaking down
(I was about to let go 'til I knew you existed)

I was on the verge of breaking down
Then you came around
And not a second too late"
Every Little Thing (Remix),Hillsong Young & Free,"Every little thing-ing-ing

Your favour waits within the future
My dreams are small compared to Yours
Why should I worry 'bout tomorrow when I know
That all I gotta do is trust You, Lord

Every little thing is gonna be alright
Every little thing is gonna be just fine
Whether I can see it now
I know You will work it out for good
Every little thing, everything will be alright

Behind the scenes and in the details
You plan the perfect way for me
Why would I dwell upon the road's uncertainties
When all I gotta do is look to You
Yeah, all I gotta do is look to You

Every little thing is gonna be alright
Every little thing is gonna be just fine
Whether I can see it now
I know You will work it out for good
Every little thing, everything will be alright

Every little thing, every little thing
Every little thing, everything will be alright

[Andy Mineo:]
Hey God, I know You don't need no one to advise You
You probably do a better job running the world than I do
I just thought I'd remind You
I've been trying to find You
It felt like Satan working overtime, times two
They say if it doesn't kill ya that refines you
But I'm trying to live, and that's bigger than survival
It's been a long night
It's been a long fight
So just remind me now
Everything will be alright

Every little thing, every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing
Every little thing, everything will be alright"

Goodness Of God,One Sonic Society,"I love You, Lord, oh, Your mercy never fails me
All my days I've been held in Your hands

Another In The Fire,Hillsong United,"There's a grace when the heart is under fire
Another way when the walls are closing in
And when I look at the space between
Where I used to be and this reckoning
I know I will never be alone

There was another in the fire
Standing next to me
There was another in the waters
Holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding
Of how I've been set free
There is a cross that bears the burden
Where another died for me

There is another in the fire

All my debt left for dead beneath the waters
I'm no longer a slave to my sin anymore
And should I fall in the space between
What remains of me and this reckoning
Either way I won't bow to the things of this world

'Cause I know

And I know I will never be alone

There is another in the fire
Standing next to me
There is another in the waters
Holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding
What power set me free
There is a grave that holds no body
And now that power lives in me

There is another in the fire
There is another in the fire
There is another in the fire
There is another in the fire

I can see

And I can see the light in the darkness
As the darkness bows to Him
I can hear the roar in the heavens
As the space between wears thin

I can feel the ground shake beneath us
As the prison walls cave in
Nothing stands between us
Nothing stands between us

And there is no other name
But the name that is Jesus
He who was and still is
And will be through it all
So come what may in the space between
All the things unseen
And this reckoning
I know I will never be alone

I know. Come on
I know I will never be alone

There'll be another in the fire
Standing next to me
There'll be another in the waters
Holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding
How good You've been to me
I'll count the joy come every battle
'Cause I know that's where You'll be

I can see the light

And I can see the light in the darkness
As the darkness bows to Him
I can hear the roar in the heavens
As the space between wears thin

I can feel the ground shake beneath us
As the prison walls cave in
Nothing stands between us
Nothing stands between

There'll be another in the fire
Standing next to me
There'll be another in the waters
Holding back the seas
And should I ever need reminding
How good You've been to me
I'll count the joy come every battle
'Cause I know that's where You'll be

Count the joy come every battle
'Cause I know that's where You'll be
Count the joy come every battle
'Cause I know that's where You'll be

Sing it again

I'll count the joy come every battle
'Cause I know that's where You'll be
I'll count the joy come every battle
'Cause I know that's where You'll be"

Whole Heart (Hold Me Now),Hillsong United,"Hold me now
In the hands that created the heavens
Find me now
Where the grace runs as deep as Your scars
You pulled me from the clay
You set me on a rock
Called me by Your Name
And made my heart whole again

Lifted up
And my knees know it's all for Your glory
I might stand
With more reasons to sing than to fear
You pulled me from the clay
Set me on a rock
Called me by Your Name
And made my heart whole again

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

Once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds me now

And that grace
Owns the ground where the grave did
Where all my shame remains
Left for dead in Your wake
You crashed those age-old gates
You left no stone unturned
You stepped out of that grave
And shouldered me all the way

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

Once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds me now

Healed and forgiven
Look where my chains are now
Death has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds that ground
And Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

Once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds me now

Healed and forgiven
Look where my chains are now
Death has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds that ground
And Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now

Healed and forgiven
Look where my chains are now
Death has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds that ground
And Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now"
Did You Feel The Mountains Tremble,UPPERROOM,"Did you feel the mountains tremble?
Did you hear the oceans roar?
When the people rose to sing of
Jesus Christ, the Risen One

Did you feel the people tremble?
Did you hear the singers roar?
When the lost began to sing of
Jesus Christ, the Saving One

(We can sing that)
We can see that, God, You're moving
A mighty river through the nations
When young and old will turn to Jesus
Fling wide you heavenly gates
Prepare the way of the risen Lord

And open up the doors
And let the music play
Let the streets resound with singing
Songs that bring Your hope
Songs that bring Your joy, joy
Dancers who dance upon injustice

And do you feel the darkness tremble?
When all the saints join in one song
When all the streams flow as one river
To wash away our brokenness
(Oh, sing it out again)
Do you feel the darkness tremble?
When all the saints join in one song
And all the streams flow as one river
To wash away our brokenness

(And hear we see)
Hear we see that, God, You're moving
A time of jubilee is coming
When young and old return to Jesus
Fling wide you heavenly gates
Prepare the way of the risen Lord

So open up the doors
And let the music play
Let the streets resound with singing
Songs that bring Your hope
Songs that bring Your joy, joy
Dancers who dance upon injustice
