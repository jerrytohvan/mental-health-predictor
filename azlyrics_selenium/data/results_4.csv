Sunflower (Remix),"Post Malone, Swae Lee, Nicky Jam & Prince Royce","[Swae Lee:]
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy (ooh)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (ooh)
Ayy, ayy
Ooh-ooh, some things you just can't refuse
She wanna ride me like a cruise and I'm not tryna lose

Then you're left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're a sunflower, I think your love would be too much
Or you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, you're the sunflower

[Nicky Jam:]
Yo no sé lo que tú tienes
Como hace' lo que quiera' con mi vida, tú te vas y luego vienes
Yo no sé que tiene' tú, pero a la ve' yo pienso que no me convienes
A veces trato de buscar una salida, rápido tú me detienes
Así de loco tú me quieres
Pero soy un loco por ti
Tú no sabe' lo que por dentro yo siento por ti
Y por má' que no quiero verte, vuelvo a repetir
Y sentir cada parte de tu cuerpo cuando estas aquí
No te puedo mentir

Siempre estoy buscándote, yeah-yey
Trato de alejarme y tú acercándote, yeah-yey
De lo que nos pasa siempre culpándote, yeah-yey
Pero se me olvida cuando te veo desnudándote
Y no sé por qué

[Post Malone:]
And you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, I think your love would be too much
Or you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, you're the sunflower

[Prince Royce:]
Ese día que te conocí
No sabia que iba a ser así
El girasol más lindo del jardín
Y verte en el amanecer
Con un beso volví a caer
Dime a dónde se fue, a dónde se fue
Y ahora me quedo con la confusión
Con sentimientos de amor y dolor
Te juro que esa no fue mi intención
La flor de antes cambió de color
Uh-uh-uh-uuh
En mi vida sólo existes tú
Baby, tell what we try to proof
Si tú sabes que yo soy tu luz

And you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, es que tu amor es just too much
Or you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, you're the sunflower"
Dancing With A Stranger,Megan Nicole,"I don't wanna be alone tonight
It's pretty clear that I'm not over you
I'm still thinking 'bout the things you do
So I don't want to be alone tonight, alone tonight, alone tonight
Can you light the fire?
I need somebody who can take control
I know exactly what I need to do
'Cause I don't wanna be alone tonight, alone tonight, alone tonight

Look what you made me do, I'm with somebody new
Ooh, baby, baby, I'm dancing with a stranger
Look what you made me do, I'm with somebody new
Ooh, baby, baby, I'm dancing with a stranger
I'm dancing with a stranger

I wasn't even going out tonight
But, boy, I need to get you off of my mind
I know exactly what I need to do
I don't wanna be alone tonight, alone tonight, alone tonight

Look what you made me do, I'm with somebody new
Ooh, baby, baby, I'm dancing with a stranger
Look what you made me do, I'm with somebody new
Ooh, baby, baby, I'm dancing with a stranger
Dancing with a stranger
Dancing with a stranger
Dancing

Look what you made me do, I'm with somebody new
Ooh, baby, baby, I'm dancing with a stranger
Look what you made me do, I'm with somebody new
Ooh, baby, baby, I'm dancing with a stranger

Bed Of Lies,Nicki Minaj,"[Skylar Grey:]
Do you ever think of me when you lie
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies?
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies?

[Nicki Minaj:]
You could never make eye contact
Everything you got was based off of my contacts
You a fraud, but I'm 'a remain icon-stat
Balenciaga's on my boots with the python strap
You was caught up in the rush, and you was caught up in the thrill of it
You was with me way before I hit a quarter mil' in it
Put you in the crib and you ain't never pay a bill in it
I was killin' it, man you got me poppin' pills in it
I told baby hit you, I said this nigga buggin'
'Cause I was doing it for us, I told 'em fuck the public
Couldn't believe that I was home alone contemplating
Overdosin', no more coastin', no more toastin' over oceans
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked all along
I'm 'a ask on the song

[Skylar Grey:]
Do you ever think of me when you lie
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies?
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies?

[Nicki Minaj:]
I just figured if you saw me, if you looked in my eyes
You'd remember our connection and be freed from the lies
I just figured I was something that you couldn't replace
But there was just a blank stare and I couldn't relate
I just couldn't understand and I couldn't defend
What we had, what we shared, and I couldn't pretend
When the tears roll down it's like you ain't even notice em
If you had a heart, I was hoping that you would show it some
What the fuck you really telling me, what you telling me
I could tell you lying, get the fuck out, don't yell at me
I ain't mean to cut you, I ain't wanna catch a felony
This ain't How To Be A Player, you ain't Bill Bellamy
They say you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
They say that your darkest hour come before your dawn
But there was something that I should've asked all along
I'm 'a ask on the song

[Skylar Grey:]
So does she know I've been in that bed before
A thousand count, and not a single thread of truth
If I was just another girl
Then I'm ashamed to say that I'm not over you
There's one thing I need to know
So call me, when you're not so busy just thinking of yourself

[Skylar Grey:]
Do you ever think of me when you lie
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies?
And I knew better than to look in your eyes
They only pretend you would be mine
And oh how you made me believe
You had me caught in every web that you weaved
But do you ever think of me when you lie
Lie down in your bed, your bed of lies?"
Second & Sebring,Of Mice & Men,"I believe it's time for me
To be famous and out of place.
I believe it's time for me
To move forward when I break through.
When I break through.
When I break through.
When I break through.

This time I'll make you,
Proud to see me over come on day light.
Proud of, who you raised.
Your shelter, your peacefulness.

So this time I'll make you proud.

Proud of, who you raised up.
You know that I will,
Always be here 'til the end.

Come back so I can say thank you for this,
Home cooked meals and a place to rest

My troubled head when you're away,
I've passed the test, I've earned an A,
Not just in school, but in life,
You'll always be right by my side.
To help me show, hope to all,
That are lost and sick in this dying world.
I'll use the love you left behind,
I'll change their minds, I'll change their minds.

I hope,
I hope you smile,
When you look down on me.
I hope you smile.

This can't, we won't know.
I hope that I make you proud.

This is not what it is, only baby scars. (These baby scars)
I need your love like a boy needs his mother's side. (I need your side)
This is not what it is, only baby scars.
I need your love like a boy needs his mother's side.

This is not what it is, only baby scars.
I need your love like a boy needs his mother's side, yeah."
The American Nightmare,Ice Nine Kills,"""Getting ready for bed at a regular time is one of the most important habits you can learn. David has probably never stopped to think what a wonderful thing sleep is. Dreams are normal too. Going to bed at a regular time each night makes it easier for you to go right off to sleep.""

Rest your head, here's a lullaby
A melody for heavy eyes
Early to bed, early to die
Welcome to your worst nightmare

Fast asleep, it's all in your head now
Past the street where they cursed my name
But I won't be forsaken
Craven my revenge from the shallow
Grave, where I went down in flames
The beast has been awakened

When night comes creeping
My cruel hand will rock you to sleep

I'm the American nightmare with American dreams
Of counting the bodies while you count sheep
I'm the American nightmare, yeah I'm living the dream
I'm slashing my way through the golden age of the silver scream
(Sweet dreams)

Fell in love with hate cause evil fit like a glove
It's fate that I'm still here
And I won't be forsaken
Wicked when I was just a man
But sickening now and fed by fear
The beast has been awakened now

They all think it's just pretend
You'll never ever sleep again
All your friends are fucking dead
You can't turn down your own death bed

When night comes creeping
My cruel hand will rock you to sleep

I'm the American nightmare with American dreams
Of counting the bodies while you count sheep
I'm the American nightmare, yeah I'm living the dream
I'm slashing my way through the golden age of the silver scream

I'm the American nightmare, I'm the man of your dreams
Where the glove is god, so I'm sinking my claws in the silver scream

One, two, dreams do come true
Three, four, see you at the morgue
Five, six, he'll get his fix
Seven, eight, now shake the twisted hand of fate
Now
Shake the twisted hand of fate
All your friends are fucking dead

When night comes creeping
My cruel hand will rock you to sleep

I'm the American nightmare with American dreams
Of counting the bodies while you count sheep
I'm the American nightmare, yeah I'm living the dream
I'm slashing my way through the golden age of the silver scream

I'm the American nightmare, I'm the man of your dreams
Where the glove is god, so I'm sinking my claws in the silver scream"
The Robot With Human Hair Pt. 2,Dance Gavin Dance,"Said it's the coming of man
And I forget when you went away
Like a kick to the face
Not winning the race
(Lion, I've seen you from afar)
I've seen her in the car
Knowing that you deserve such more
Deserved to know you're free

Leave, I'm the director
Agree to the role of the pilot inspector
Breathe, pilot inspector
Feed off the role of the radar detector
Leave, I'm the director
Agree to the role of the pilot inspector
Breathe, pilot inspector
Feed off the role of the radar detector

Well, then, you said you could do this on your own
I'm sorry baby, I can't aid you
(And then you say, hands down, right now, I'll let this go)
You...
Well, now it's up to god to save you

Save you from all of those bruised,
bruised and battered wounds
(Wave right with a gun in his hand wave right)
Can you taste this blood
Dripping sweeter than...?
And over your eyes
And I, and I fall to both knees
Not to beg for your forgiveness
But to hate the word
And you speak

Take a right off these cliffs
The ground is staring at your wounded weapons
Wounded weapons
(And I can't believe that you're right)
You can bank the night on this its round
And glaring at your well
I get hyphy
Tell 'em I get hyphy

And this is where it ends

Well, then, you said you could do this on your own
I'm sorry baby, I can't aid you
(And then you say, hands down, right now, I'll let this go)
You...
Well, now it's up to god to save you

Save you, save you
Save you, save you

I can't believe these long words
Come from many national absurd
This is a line cut across
Hope, defeat, the line, the loss
I can never be this lone wolf
You can never see me across this earth
This will be a light that I run from
You thought you were so strong
You pleaded to never be wrong

(Brace yourself, fasten belts)
Well, now that you go
(Close the hatch, flip the latch)
I sit here and wonder
(They're not dead, speed ahead)
Times have changed
It's like we've been trashing silos
(Well, now that you go)
In the time bomb aisle
(I sit here and wonder)
Maybe they'll dodge the spill
Oil kills, sure it will

And I can't breathe the air
(Hide your daughter 'cause I'm coming over)
To reach for this light
(You know I'm not lying about)
(Trashing silos in the time bomb aisle)
And you can't breathe the air
(About trashing silos in the time bomb aisle)
Not leaving her to reach
The line, the work, the rope, the love

And I have seen such worse for you

It's a no, I'm not coming back
It's a no, I'm not coming back
It's a no, I'm not coming back

And now you see the sky has turned black
Why do think everyone has turned back?
It's cause he's gone

And now you see the sky has turned black
Why do think everyone has turned back?
It's cause he's gone

And now you see the sky has turned black
Why do think everyone has turned back?
It's cause he's gone"
As You Find Me,Hillsong United,"I've been strong and I've been broken within a moment
I've been faithful and I've been reckless at every bend
I've held everything together and watched it shatter
I've stood tall and I have crumbled in the same breath

I have wrestled and I have trembled toward surrender
Chased my heart adrift and drifted home again
Plundered blessing till I've been desperate to find redemption
And every time I turn around Lord You're still there

I was found before I was lost
I was Yours before I was not
Grace to spare for all my mistakes
And that part just wrecks me

And I know I
I don't deserve this kind of love
Somehow
This kind of love is who You are
It's a grace I could never add up
To be somebody You still want
Somehow
You love me as You find me

Who am I to think Your glory needs my praises
But if this borrowed breath is Yours Lord take it all
You are faithful and You are gracious and I'm just grateful
To think you don't need a single thing and still You want my heart

I was found before I was lost
I was Yours before I was not
You wear the scars
And that part just wrecks me

And I know I
I don't deserve this kind of love
Somehow
This kind of love is who You are
It's a grace I could never add up
To be somebody You still want
Somehow
You love me as You find me
You love me as You find me
You love me as You find me
You love me as You find me

Your love's too good to leave me here (You love me as You find me)
Your love's too good to leave me here (You love me as You find me)
Your love's too good to leave me here (You love me as You find me)
Your love's too good to leave me here (You love me as You find me)
Your love's too good to leave me here
If you want my heart I won't second guess
Cause I need Your love more than anything
I'm in
I'm Yours
Your love's too good to leave me here
Your love's too good to leave me here
Your love's too good

And I know I
I don't deserve this kind of love
Somehow
This kind of love is who You are
It's a grace I could never add up
To be somebody You still want
Somehow
You love me as You find me
You love me as You find me
You love me as You find me"
Whole Heart (Hold Me Now),Hillsong United,"Hold me now
In the hands that created the heavens
Find me now
Where the grace runs as deep as Your scars
You pulled me from the clay
You set me on a rock
Called me by Your Name
And made my heart whole again

Lifted up
And my knees know it's all for Your glory
I might stand
With more reasons to sing than to fear
You pulled me from the clay
Set me on a rock
Called me by Your Name
And made my heart whole again

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

Once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds me now

And that grace
Owns the ground where the grave did
Where all my shame remains
Left for dead in Your wake
You crashed those age-old gates
You left no stone unturned
You stepped out of that grave
And shouldered me all the way

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

Once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds me now

Healed and forgiven
Look where my chains are now
Death has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds that ground
And Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

Once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds me now

Healed and forgiven
Look where my chains are now
Death has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds that ground
And Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now

Healed and forgiven
Look where my chains are now
Death has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds that ground
And Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now"
Bury A Friend,NateWantsToBattle,"What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

Come here
Say it, spit it out, what is it exactly
You're payin'? Is the amount cleanin' you out? Am I satisfactory?
Today, I'm thinkin' about the things that are deadly
The way I'm drinkin' you down
Like I wanna drown, like I wanna end me

Step on the glass, staple your tongue (ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna... end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna...

What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

Keep you in the dark, what had you expected?
Me to make you my art and make you a star
And get you connected?
I'll meet you in the park, I'll be calm and collected
But we knew right from the start that you'd fall apart
'Cause I'm too expensive
It's probably somethin' that shouldn't be said out loud
Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (wow)
Calling security, keepin' my head held down
Bury the hatchet or bury a friend right now

For the debt I owe, gotta sell my soul
'Cause I can't say no, no, I can't say no
Then my limbs all froze and my eyes won't close
And I can't say no, I can't say no
Careful

Step on the glass, staple your tongue (ahh)
Bury a friend, try to wake up (ahh)
Cannibal class, killing the son (ahh)
Bury a friend, I wanna end me

I wanna end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna... end me
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna...

What do you want from me? Why don't you run from me?
What are you wondering? What do you know?
Why aren't you scared of me? Why do you care for me?
When we all fall asleep, where do we go?"

I've been playing myself, baby I don't care
Baby your love's got the best of me
Your love's got the best of me
Baby your love's got the best of me
Baby you're making a fool of me
You got me sprung and I don't care who sees
Cause baby you got me, you got me, oh you got me, you got me

I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two or three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
And I still don't understand
Just how your love could do what no one else can

Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (your love)

Hoping you'll save me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now (your love)
Looking so crazy in love
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now

Got me hoping you'll save me right now

I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me),Fall Out Boy,"Clocks strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away
I've done alright up 'til now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls
My loneliness calls

Oh! I wanna dance with somebody
I want to feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh! I wanna dance with somebody
I want to feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me, yeah

I've been in love and lost my senses
Spinning through the town
Sooner or later the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down
I need a one who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls

Oh! I wanna dance with somebody
I want to feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh! I wanna dance with somebody
I want to feel the heat...
Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Somebody, somebody
Somebody who loves me
Somebody who, somebody who
To hold me in her arms
I need a one who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My loneliness calls

Oh! I wanna dance with somebody
I want to feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I wanna dance with somebody

Up,Olly Murs,"I drew a broken heart
Right on your window pane
Waited for your reply
Here in the pouring rain

Just breathe against the glass
Leave me some kind of sign
I know the hurt won't pass
Yeah
Just tell me it's not the end of the line
Just tell me it's not the end of the line

I never meant to break your heart
And I won't let this plane go down
I never meant to make you cry
I'll do what it takes to make this fly
Oh

You gotta hold on
Hold on to what you're feeling
That feeling is the best thing
The best thing, alright
I'm gonna place my bet on us
I know this love is heading in the same direction
That's up

You drew a question mark
But you know what I want
I wanna turn the clock
Yeah
Right back to where it was

So, let's build a bridge
Yeah
From your side to mine
I'll be the one to cross over
Just tell me it's not the end of the line
Just tell me it's not the end of the line

I never meant to break your heart
And I won't let this plane go down
I never meant to make you cry
I'll do what it takes to make this fly
Oh

Hold on to what you're feeling
That feeling is the best thing
The best thing, alright
I'm gonna place my bet on us
I know this love is heading in the same direction
That's up

Girl, I know we could climb back to where we were then
Feel it here in my heart
Put my heart in your hand
Well, I hope and I pray that you do understand
If you did, all you have to say is
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm waiting for you

Always Remember Us This Way (Arizona Sky) (Acoustic),Tyler Ward,"That Arizona sky
Burnin' in your eyes
You look at me and babe I wanna catch on fire
It's buried in my soul
Like California gold
You found the light in me that I couldn't find

So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
And every time we say goodbye, baby it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

Lovers in the night
Poets tryin' to write
We don't know how to rhyme but damn we'll try
But all I really know
You're where I wanna go
The part of me that's you will never die

So when I'm all choked up and I can't find the words
Every time we say goodbye baby it hurts
When the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way

Yeah when the sun goes down
And the band won't play
I'll always remember us this way"

I Don't Care (Acoustic),Ed Sheeran,"I'm at a party I don't wanna be at
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie, I
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
Nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes
And then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say, ""Shall we dance?"" (Hell Yeah)
You know I love ya, did I ever tell ya?
You make it better like that

Don't think I fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say, yeah
I always feel like I'm nobody, mmm
Who wants to fit in anyway?

You can take me anywhere

We at a party we don't wanna be at
Tryna talk, but we can't hear ourselves
Read your lips, I'd rather kiss 'em right back
With all these people all around
I'm crippled with anxiety
But I'm told it's where I'm s'posed to be
You know what? It's kinda crazy 'cause I really don't mind
When you make it better like that

Don't think we fit in at this party

When we walked in, I said I'm sorry
But now I think that we should stay

Lay Me Down,Sam Smith,"Yes, I do, I believe
That one day I will be
Where I was right there
Right next to you

And it's hard
The days just seem so dark
The moon and the stars
Are nothing without you

Your touch, your skin
Where do I begin?
No words can explain
The way I'm missing you

Deny this emptiness
This hole that I'm inside
These tears
They tell their own story

Told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

Can I lay by your side?
Next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call?
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy

[This verse is only in the album version:]
You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

Can I lay by your side?
Next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

Lay me down tonight
Lay me by your side
Lay me down tonight
Lay me by your side
Can I lay by your side?
Next to you
You"
Make It To Me,Sam Smith,"My mind runs away to you
With a thought I'd hope you'll see
Can't see where it's wandered to
But I know where it wants to be

I'm waiting patiently though time is moving slow
I have one vacancy and I wanted you to know that

You're the one designed for me
A distant stranger that I will complete
I know you're out there, we're meant to be
So keep your head up and make it to me
And make it to me

So sick of this lonely air
It seems such a waste of breath
So much that I need to share
So much to get off my chest

I'm waiting patiently though time is moving slow
I have one vacancy and I wanted you to know that

You're the one designed for me
A distant stranger that I will complete
I know you're out there, we're meant to be
So keep your head up and make it to me
Make it to me
Make it to me
Make it to me"
If You Could See Me Now,The Script,"(Oh if you could see me now)

(Oh if you could see me now)

It was February 14 Valentine's Day
The roses came but they took you away
Tattooed on my arm is a charm to disarm all the harm
Gotta keep myself calm but the truth is you're gone
And I'll never get to show you these songs
Dad you should see the tours that I'm on
I see you standing there next to Mom
Both singing along, yeah arm in arm
Now there are days when I'm losing my faith
Because the man wasn't good he was great
He'd say ""Music was the home for your pain""
And explain I was young, he would say,
""Take that rage, put it on a page.
Take the page to the stage.
Blow the roof off the place.""
I'm trying to make you proud
Do everything you did
I hope you're up there with God saying, ""That's my kid!""

[Chorus:]
I still look for your face in the crowd
Oh if you could see me now (Oh if you could see me now)
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow?
Oh if you could see me now (Oh if you could see me now)

(Oh if you could see me now)

If you could see me now would you recognize me?
Would you pat me on the back or would you criticize me?
Would you follow every line on my tear-stained face
Put your hand on a heart that was cold
As the day you were taken away?
I know it's been a while but I can see you clear as day
Right now, I wish I could hear you say
I drink too much, and I smoke too much dutch
But if you can't see me now that shit's a must
You used to say I won't know a win until it cost me
Like I won't know real love 'til I've loved and I've lost it
So if you've lost a sister, someone's lost a mom
And if you've lost a dad then someone's lost a son
And they're all missing out, yeah they're all missing out
So if you get a second to look down on me now
Mom, Dad I'm just missing you now

I still look for your face in the crowd
Oh if you could see me now (Oh if you could see me now)
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow?
Oh if you could see me now (Oh if you could see me now)

Oh, oh
Would you call me a saint or a sinner?
Would you love me a loser or winner?
Oh, oh
When I see my face in the mirror
We look so alike that it makes me shiver

I still look for your face in the crowd
Oh if you could see me now (Oh if you could see me now)
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow?
Oh if you could see me now (Oh if you could see me now)
Yeah I'm just missing you now

I still look for your face in the crowd
Oh if you could see me now (Oh if you could see me now)
Would you stand in disgrace or take a bow?
Oh if you could see me now (Oh if you could see me now)

You could see, you could see me now [2x]"
Sweet Hurricane,Phum Viphurit,"I was sailing alone
You came along
I'm singing the song you wrote
You led the way
I couldn't say
Words became lumps in my throat

I, I'm loving this sweet hurricane
In time, I know we'll meet once again

When you're alone
It's with you, I belong

Stories we told
Will never get old
Though the fire's gone cold, you're my flame

I, I'm loving this sweet hurricane
In time, I know we'll meet once again"
Whole Heart (Hold Me Now),Hillsong United,"Hold me now
In the hands that created the heavens
Find me now
Where the grace runs as deep as Your scars
You pulled me from the clay
You set me on a rock
Called me by Your Name
And made my heart whole again

Lifted up
And my knees know it's all for Your glory
I might stand
With more reasons to sing than to fear
You pulled me from the clay
Set me on a rock
Called me by Your Name
And made my heart whole again

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

Once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds me now

And that grace
Owns the ground where the grave did
Where all my shame remains
Left for dead in Your wake
You crashed those age-old gates
You left no stone unturned
You stepped out of that grave
And shouldered me all the way

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

Once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds me now

Healed and forgiven
Look where my chains are now
Death has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds that ground
And Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

So here I stand
High in surrender
I need You now
Hold my heart
Now and forever
My soul cries out

Once I was broken
But You loved my whole heart through
Sin has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds me now

Healed and forgiven
Look where my chains are now
Death has no hold on me
'Cause Your grace holds that ground
And Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now
Your grace holds me now

Healed and forgiven
Look where my chains are now

Nervous,Gavin James,"I promise that I'll hold you when it's cold out
When we lose our winter coats in the spring
Cause lately I was thinking I never told you
That every time I see you my heart sings

Cause we lived at the carnival in summer
We scared ourselves to death on a ghost train
And just like every ferris wheel stops turning
Oh I guess we had an expiration date
So I won't say I love you, it's too late

And oooooooooh
Ooooohohoooooh
And oooohoooooooh
Ohoooohohohoooooh

Cause every time I saw you I got nervous
Shivering and shaking at the knees
And just like every song I haven't heard yet no
I didn't know the words in front of me
In front of me, and oooooooh
But I don't wanna know

Who'll take you home?
Who'll take you home?
Who'll take you home?
Hoooooome
If I let you gooooooooooo

And oooooohhhhh
And oooooohhhhh
And oooooohhhhh
Oooooooohooooohoohhhh

Now that you're on someone else's shoulders
The winter winds are colder on my own
Maybe we will meet when we get older
Maybe we won't
So I won't say I love you if you don't
And no you don't
So I won't say I love you if you don't"
none,none,none
Adore,Phum Viphurit,"The clouds are changing
The storm, she's coming, quick hide
But who needs the shelter
When you are by my side

You had me at hello
You caught me by surprise
Oh how I lost my senses
When I met those hazel eyes

Woah...
Oh what a shame, we are parting ways
In a time set for us two
But if you should ask me
Do I adore you?
I think you know I do

I think you know I do-dodo-do-do-doo
I do-dodo-dodo-do-doo
I do-dodo-do-do-doo
Do-do-do-dooo
You know I do-dodo-dodo-doo
I do-dodo-dodo-do-doo
I do-dodo-do-do-doo do-do-do-doo

I'd build you castles and endless daisy chains
Mend all that's broken, for you love I will regain
(For your love, I will regain...)

Oh what a shame, we are parting ways
In a time set for us two
But if you should ask me
Do I adore you
I think you know I do

I think you know I do-dodo-do-do-doo
I do-dodo-dodo-do-doo
I do-dodo-do-do-doo
Do-do-do-dooo
You know I do-dodo-dodo-doo
I do-dodo-dodo-do-doo
I do-dodo-do-do-doo do-do-do-doo

This wind is cold
Our love is old
Do you remember?
Remember me

Oh what a shame, we are parting ways
In a time set for us two
But if you should ask me
Do I adore you
I think you know I

I think you know I
Oh what a shame, we are parting ways
In a time set for us two
But if you should ask me
Do I adore you
I think you know I do

I think you know I do-dodo-do-do-doo
I do-dodo-dodo-do-doo
I do-dodo-do-do-doo
Do-do-do-dooo
You know I do-dodo-dodo-doo
I do-dodo-dodo-do-doo

Come on.

Everybody's looking for love.
Ain't that the reason you're at this club.
You ain't gon' find it dancing with him. No.
I've got a better solution for you, girl.

Just leave with me now. Say the word and we'll go.
I'll be your teacher. I'll show you the ropes.
You'll see a side of love you've never known.
I can see it going down, going down.

In my head I see you all over me.
In my head you fulfill my fantasy.
In my head you'll be screaming more.
In my head it's going down.
In my head it's going down.
In my head. In my head.

Come on.

Some dudes know all the right things to say.
When it comes down to it, it's all just game.
Instead of talking let me demonstrate.
Get down to business and skip foreplay.

Just leave with me now. Say the word and we'll go. We can go.
I'll be your teacher. I'll show you the ropes.
You'll see a side of love you've never known.
I can see it going down, going down.

In my head I see you all over me. Baby, all over me.
In my head you fulfill my fantasy.
In my head you'll be screaming more.
In my head it's going down.
In my head it's going down.
In my head.

Break it down. Come on. Let's go.
You're singing to me baby in my head right now.
Come on.
She'll be screaming out when it all goes down.

Just leave with me now. Say the word and we'll go. We can go.
I'll be your teacher. I'll show you the ropes.
You'll see a side of love you've never known.
I can see it going down, going down.

In my head I see you all over me.
In my head you fulfill my fantasy.
In my head you'll be screaming more.
In my head it's going down.
In my head it's going down.

In my head I see you all over me. All over you.
In my head you fulfill my fantasy.
In my head you'll be screaming more.
In my head it's going down.
In my head it's going down.
In my head."
